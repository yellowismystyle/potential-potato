Let's break down the components to understand what additional information might be relevant for retrieving the best products:\n\n1. **104 BCD**: This is a specific bolt circle diameter commonly used in mountain bikes. It is essential to retain this specification as it will filter the crank arms to those compatible with a 104mm bolt circle.\n\n2. **Crank Arms**: This refers to the component of the bicycle drivetrain that connects the pedals to the crankset. The customer is interested solely in the arms, not the entire crankset or chainring.\n\n3. **Without Chainring**: The customer does not want the product to include a chainring, which is the toothed ring that engages with the bicycle chain.\n\nTo enhance the query, we could consider adding related terms and specifications that may help in retrieving the best possible products:\n\n- **Material**: Crank arms are commonly made from aluminum, carbon, or steel. Specifying a material might be useful if the customer has a preference, but since it's not mentioned, we will leave it out unless additional context is provided.\n  \n- **Length**: Crank arms come in various lengths, typically ranging from 165mm to 175mm. Again, this is not specified, so we will not include it.\n  \n- **Compatibility**: Ensuring compatibility with specific bike types (e.g., mountain bike, road bike) might be useful, but given the 104 BCD, it's mostly implied for mountain bikes.\n\n- **Brand Names**: Mentioning popular brands known for crank arms (e.g., Shimano, SRAM, Race Face) might help, but unless the customer indicates a brand preference, it is not necessary.\n\nUltimately, the query is quite specific and does not require much expansion apart from making sure the terms are clearly understood.
