Identify the main topic: The main topic is \"not being a liberal\", which can be further broken down into \"conservative\" or \"right-wing\" ideologies.\n2. Identify relevant keywords: Some possible keywords related to conservative or right-wing ideologies include \"conservative\", \"traditional\", \"patriotic\", \"fiscal conservatism\", \"social conservatism\", \"limited government\", \"free market\", \"individual freedom\", \"law and order\", \"nationalism\", and \"traditional values\".\n3. Identify relevant phrases: Some possible phrases that might be related to the query include \"reasons to be conservative\", \"conservative views\", \"right-wing ideologies\", \"opposite of liberal\", and \"conservative arguments\".\n4. Consider the number \"13.5\" in the query: This number might be a red herring, but it could also be a hint to include a specific aspect of conservatism, such as \"13 reasons\" or \"half a dozen\" arguments.\n5. Combine the keywords and phrases: Using Boolean operators, I can combine the keywords and phrases to create a query that retrieves relevant products. For example, I can use the \"OR\" operator to include all the keywords and phrases, and the \"AND\" operator to narrow down the results to products that include both \"conservative\" and \"reasons to be conservative\".\n6.

I consider the context of the query, which is likely an e-commerce or online marketplace platform. I think about the most relevant attributes that customers might use to search for this product, such as brand, product type, and color range. I also consider the fact that the query specifies 72, which might refer to the set size of the pencils. I decide to use the Boolean operators AND and OR to structure the query logically. I think about the possible variations of the query and how to phrase them to get the most relevant results. I decide to use the exact phrase \"Prismacolor Premier\" to ensure the query returns only products with the exact name, and \"colored pencils\" to specify the product type. I also consider adding the \"72\" to the query to filter the results to sets of 72 pencils. I think about the fact that customers might also search for other terms related to the product, such as \"set\", \"pack\", or \"set of 72\", to get more relevant results. I decide to use the OR operator to include these variations in the query.

The term \"mask\" suggests a product related to face masks, possibly for medical or protective purposes. \"Chain\" implies a physical connection or attachment, possibly a lanyard. I consider the context of a lanyard, which is often used to hold or attach identification cards, keys, or other small items. I also think about the types of masks that might be relevant, such as surgical masks, respirator masks, or face shields. I consider the materials that lanyards are typically made of, such as nylon, leather, or fabric. I also think about the features that might be important for a lanyard, such as adjustable length, clip, or carabiner attachment. I also consider the context in which a mask chain lanyard might be used, such as in a medical setting, a festival, or a sporting event. I combine these ideas to create a query that captures the essential characteristics of the product. I use Boolean operators to structure the query logically and ensure that the most relevant results are returned. I use the OR operator to include different types of masks and lanyard materials, and the AND operator to specify the features that are most important for the product. I also use quotes to ensure that the exact phrase \"mask chain lanyard\" is searched for, rather than individual words. I consider the context of the search, such as the target audience and the purpose of the product, to refine the query and ensure that the most relevant results are returned. I use the minus operator to exclude irrelevant results, such as products that are not related to masks or lanyards. I also use the site operator to search within a specific website or online store, if applicable.
