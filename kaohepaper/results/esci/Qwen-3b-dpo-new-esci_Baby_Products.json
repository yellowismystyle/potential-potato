        "generated_text": "1. **Understanding the Query:**\n   - The query is \"your germs are too big for me sign\". This suggests that the query is related to a sign or a sticker that emphasizes the idea that germs are too large to be comfortable or acceptable. The query is likely to be used in a context where people are looking for signs or stickers to express their disgust or discomfort with germs.\n\n2. **Identifying Key Components:**\n   - **\"Your germs are too big for me\"** - This is the main message or sentiment expressed in the query.\n   - **\"Sign\" or \"Sticker\"** - This specifies the type of product, which is crucial for filtering the search results.\n\n3. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Type of Product:** We need to ensure that the search results include only signs or stickers, not other types of products.\n   - **Sentiment/Message:** We need to ensure that the search results include products that convey the sentiment of \"your germs are too big for me\".\n\n4. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND** - Both conditions must be met (type of product and sentiment).\n   - **OR** - Either condition can be met, but both are necessary for comprehensive search results.\n\n5. **Query Structure:**\n   - **AND** - Ensure that the search results include only products that are signs or stickers AND that they convey the sentiment of \"your germs are too big for me\".\n   - **OR** - Ensure that the search results include products that convey the sentiment of \"your germs are too big for me\" OR products that are signs or stickers.\n\n6. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Type of Product:** \"Sign\" or \"Sticker\"\n   - **Sentiment/Message:** \"Your germs are too big for me\"\n\n7. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND** - Ensure both conditions are met\n   - **OR** - Ensure either condition is met\n\n8. **Final Query:**\n   - **AND** - Ensure both the type of product AND the sentiment are met\n   - **OR** - Ensure either the type of product OR the sentiment is met\n\n9. **JSON Format:**\n   - The query should be structured in a logical manner using AND and OR operators.\n\nLet's construct the query:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(Type of Product: Sign OR Type of Product: Sticker) AND (Sentiment/Message: Your germs are too big for me OR Sentiment/Message: Your germs are too big for me) AND (Type of Product: Sign OR Type of Product: Sticker) AND (Sentiment/Message: Your germs are too big for me)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis query ensures that the search results include products that are either signs or stickers AND that they convey the sentiment of \"your germs are too big for me\". Additionally, it ensures that the search results include products that are either signs or stickers OR that they convey the sentiment of \"your germs are too big for me\".\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(Type of Product: Sign OR Type of Product: Sticker) AND (Sentiment/Message: Your germs are too big for me OR Sentiment/Message: Your germs are too big for me) AND (Type of Product: Sign OR Type of Product: Sticker) AND (Sentiment/Message: Your germs are too big for me)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the search results are comprehensive and cover all necessary conditions.
