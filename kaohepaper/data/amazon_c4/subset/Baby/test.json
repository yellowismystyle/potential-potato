I fit about 5 days of clothes in this along with my toiletries/makeup, hair straightener, and some other odds and ends. This thing can fit quite a lot and is extremely well made.

I'm not saying it in a bad way, I'm just saying there are no surprises here in terms of the quality you'll get. The fleece material feels soft on the underside of the bib, and the top layer with the graphics feels equally nice and soft to the touch. The bib itself has a good thickness to it, not too thick, not too thin. It washed well and did not rip or tear after one cycle. The bib is very nicely stitched and sewn, and the buttons are as well.<br /><br />I'm glad the seller offers some gender neutral choices in addition to the more girly and feminine choice. This set is definitely one of the more nicely packaged ones, and for that alone I would highly recommend purchasing from this seller. The price is competitive to other sellers that have a plain poly bag packaging. I like this one because it just looks more organized, clean, and quality. I would not feel embarrassed gifting this set to my friends and family unlike some of the other bib sets that I've purchased previously where it was just thrown in a poly bag, making it look really cheap. I also highly recommend getting more than one set (10 pack), especially if your little one is at the height of their teething and drooling a lot more than usual. The more you get the less you have to worry about doing baby laundry on a daily basis. I noticed there is a discount coupon right now so if you see that offer make sure to apply it, which will save you a few dollars more. I am very satisfied with this set and have absolutely no complaints."

It absorbs well and dries slower than terry cloth towels but the softness makes it worth it. It fits baby well and is perfect for bathtime. It's great that it can also be used as a blanket or mat, but I prefer it as a luxurious towel that is as soft as my baby. No change after washing in cold water and dried on a low tumble. Would definitely recommend it as a gift or if you find terry cloth towels are just too rough to begin with, or become rough after washing."

I've bought about 5 for my friends when they have their first kid. You don't NEED it for diaper cream, but why make your life harder and messier? Just spread your cream on the spatula and apply. Wipe the spatula clean and it's ready for your next diaper change. It's a great gift, especially because new parents might not even think that this product exists. There's even a mini size for travel."
