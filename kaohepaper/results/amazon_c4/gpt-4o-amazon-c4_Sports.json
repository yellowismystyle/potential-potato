We want to ensure that the query captures the essence of the customer's needs by combining these attributes logically.\n\n- We should use \"AND\" to combine different categories (e.g., type of equipment, quality, size, noise level) because the customer wants all these features.\n- We can use \"OR\" to list different types of exercise equipment or different synonyms for similar attributes.\n\nQuery Structure:\n(\"exercise equipment\" OR \"treadmill\" OR \"stationary bike\" OR \"elliptical\")\nAND (\"durable\" OR \"high quality\" OR \"sturdy\")\nAND (\"compact\" OR \"space-saving\" OR \"small footprint\")\nAND (\"quiet\" OR \"low noise\" OR \"silent\")\nAND (\"reliable\" OR \"effective\" OR \"efficient\")\nAND (\"fitness\" OR \"stamina\" OR \"cardio\" OR \"endurance\")\nAND (\"value\" OR \"worthwhile\" OR \"best buy\" OR \"affordable\")\n\nThis structure ensures we cover all aspects of the customer's needs while allowing flexibility in product types and synonyms.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n{\n    \"query\": \"(\\\"exercise equipment\\\" OR \\\"treadmill\\\" OR \\\"stationary bike\\\" OR \\\"elliptical\\\") AND (\\\"durable\\\" OR \\\"high quality\\\" OR \\\"sturdy\\\") AND (\\\"compact\\\" OR \\\"space-saving\\\" OR \\\"small footprint\\\") AND (\\\"quiet\\\" OR \\\"low noise\\\" OR \\\"silent\\\") AND (\\\"reliable\\\" OR \\\"effective\\\" OR \\\"efficient\\\") AND (\\\"fitness\\\" OR \\\"stamina\\\" OR \\\"cardio\\\" OR \\\"endurance\\\") AND (\\\"value\\\" OR \\\"worthwhile\\\" OR \\\"best buy\\\" OR \\\"affordable\\\")\"\n}\n</answer>",
