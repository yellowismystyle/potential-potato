Keywords to consider are \"customizable\", \"software\", \"programmable\", \"macro\", \"profiles\", \"adjustable\".\n\n2. **Battery life and RGB lighting**: The mouse should have good battery life and the ability to turn off RGB lighting. Relevant terms include \"battery life\", \"RGB lighting\", \"customizable lighting\", \"energy-saving\".\n\n3. **Wireless charging with mouse pad**: The requirement for wireless charging using a mouse pad suggests searching for \"wireless charging\", \"Qi charging\", \"charging pad\".\n\n4. **Durability for work and gaming**: The need for durability in both work and gaming contexts implies looking for terms such as \"durable\", \"gaming mouse\", \"work mouse\", \"heavy-duty\".\n\n5. **Price is not a concern**: This indicates that premium or high-end options are acceptable, so terms related to high-end models could be included, though price-specific terms aren't directly necessary.\n\nUsing Boolean operators, we can structure the query logically to ensure all aspects are covered:\n- Use AND to ensure all main requirements are met.\n- Use OR within each category to cover variations in terminology.\n\nNow, let's construct the query:\n\n(query: \n(\"mouse\" AND \n(\"customizable\" OR \"programmable\" OR \"macro\" OR \"profiles\" OR \"adjustable\") AND \n(\"battery life\" AND (\"RGB lighting\" OR \"customizable lighting\" OR \"energy-saving\")) AND \n(\"wireless charging\" OR \"Qi charging\" OR \"charging pad\") AND \n(\"durable\" AND (\"gaming mouse\" OR \"work mouse\" OR \"heavy-duty\")))\n)\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n{\n    \"query\": \"mouse AND (customizable OR programmable OR macro OR profiles OR adjustable) AND (battery life AND (RGB lighting OR customizable lighting OR energy-saving)) AND (wireless charging OR Qi charging OR charging pad) AND (durable AND (gaming mouse OR work mouse OR heavy-duty))\"\n}\n</answer>",
