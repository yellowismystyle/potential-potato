The query \"hsa eligible products only baby\" can be analyzed as follows:\n- \"hsa\" stands for Health Savings Account, which is a type of savings account that can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses.\n- \"eligible products\" implies that we are looking for products that are covered under HSA plans.\n- \"only\" suggests that we want to exclude any non-eligible products.\n- \"baby\" specifies the product category we are interested in.\n\nTo structure the query logically, we can use Boolean operators. We can use \"AND\" to combine the conditions and \"NOT\" to exclude non-eligible products. The query can be rewritten as:\n\"hsa eligible AND baby AND NOT non-baby product\"\n\nHowever, this query might not be very effective because it doesn't account for the fact that \"baby\" is a product category, not a specific product. A more effective approach would be to use the \"OR\" operator to include all products related to babies, and then use the \"NOT\" operator to exclude non-eligible products.

I consider the context of the query, which is likely related to baby products or bedding. I think about the characteristics of the product, which are swaddling and lightweight. I also consider the importance of these characteristics, with swaddling being a primary function and lightweight being a desirable feature. I decide to prioritize the \"swaddle\" term to ensure the query retrieves products that are specifically designed for swaddling. I also want to include \"blanket\" to capture a broader range of products, including those that are lightweight blankets. To ensure the query retrieves lightweight blankets, I add the \"lightweight\" term. I use the Boolean operator \"AND\" to combine the terms, as I want to retrieve products that meet both criteria. I also consider the possibility of other keywords that might be relevant, such as \"baby\" or \"sleep\", but decide against adding them as they are not essential to the primary function of the query. I choose to use the OR operator to allow for some flexibility in the query, in case the user is looking for products that are not specifically designed for swaddling but still meet the lightweight criterion. I decide to use the OR operator with \"baby\" to capture products that are suitable for babies, but not necessarily designed for swaddling. I also consider the possibility of other keywords like \"sleep\" or \"bedding\", but decide against adding them as they are not essential to the primary function of the query.
