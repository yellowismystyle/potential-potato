Related terms could be \"infant,\" \"0-3 months,\" \"baby,\" and \"new baby.\"\n\n2. Structuring the Query:\n   - Use the AND operator to combine the concepts of the product type and the age category because both need to be present for the product to be relevant.\n   - Use the OR operator to list synonyms or related terms within each category to broaden the search and capture products that might use different terminology.\n\n3. Construct the Query:\n   - We want products that are any type of sleepsuit (sleepsuit, sleepwear, onesie, romper, pajamas, bodysuit) AND specifically for newborns or similar age categories (newborn, infant, 0-3 months, baby, new baby).\n   \nTherefore, the structured query would look something like this:</think>\n\n<answer>\n{\n    \"query\": \"(sleepsuit OR sleepwear OR onesie OR romper OR pajamas OR bodysuit) AND (newborn OR infant OR '0-3 months' OR baby OR 'new baby')\"\n}\n</answer>",

Synonyms or related terms could include \"compact,\" \"narrow,\" or \"thin.\"\n\n2. \"Diaper changing pad\" is the primary product of interest. It is important to keep this intact as it directly specifies what the customer is looking for. Synonyms or related terms could include \"baby changing pad\" or simply \"changing mat.\"\n\nUsing Boolean operators, we should ensure that all parts of the query are logically structured to capture different variations that still meet the customer's needs.\n\nThe final query should ensure that the product is both slim and a diaper changing pad, allowing for some flexibility in terminology. We can structure it as:\n- Products should include either \"diaper changing pad\" or \"baby changing pad\" or \"changing mat.\"\n- Products should include either \"slim,\" \"compact,\" \"narrow,\" or \"thin.\"\n\nThis leads to the following structured query:\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n{\n    \"query\": \"(\\\"diaper changing pad\\\" OR \\\"baby changing pad\\\" OR \\\"changing mat\\\") AND (\\\"slim\\\" OR \\\"compact\\\" OR \\\"narrow\\\" OR \\\"thin\\\")\"\n}\n</answer>",
