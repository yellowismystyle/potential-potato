  "407_1. **Understanding the Query:**\n   - The query is \"10 lb fly fishing leader\". This specifies a leader with a weight of 10 pounds, which is a specific type of fishing leader. The goal is to ensure that the query retrieves products that are both 10 lb and of the correct type.\n\n2. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND:** Ensures that both conditions must be met.\n   - **OR:** Ensures that at least one of the conditions must be met.\n\n3. **Query Components:**\n   - **Condition 1:** The leader must be 10 lb.\n   - **Condition 2:** The leader must be of the correct type (e.g., a 10 lb leader for fly fishing).\n\n4. **Query Structure:**\n   - The query should ensure that both conditions are met, and it should also ensure that the query is broad enough to capture a wide range of products, but still specific enough to ensure relevance.\n\n5. **Query Terms:**\n   - **10 lb:** This ensures that the weight is correct.\n   - **Fly Fishing:** This ensures that the leader is designed for fly fishing.\n   - **OR:** Ensures that the query is broad enough to capture products that might not explicitly state \"10 lb\" but are still 10 lb.\n   - **AND:** Ensures that both the weight and the type are correct.\n\n6. **Boolean Logic:**\n   - The query should be structured as follows:\n     - **Condition 1 (10 lb):** Ensure that the weight is 10 lb.\n     - **Condition 2 (Fly Fishing):** Ensure that the leader is designed for fly fishing.\n     - **OR:** Ensure that the query is broad enough to capture products that might not explicitly state \"10 lb\".\n     - **AND:** Ensure that both conditions are met.\n\n7. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should ensure that both the weight and the type are correct, and it should be broad enough to capture a wide range of products.\n\n8. **JSON Format:**\n   - The query should be structured in a logical manner, ensuring that both conditions are met and that the query is broad enough to capture a wide range of products.\n\nLet's construct the query:\n\n- **Condition 1 (10 lb):** Ensure that the weight is 10 lb.\n- **Condition 2 (Fly Fishing):** Ensure that the leader is designed for fly fishing.\n- **OR:** Ensure that the query is broad enough to capture products that might not explicitly state \"10 lb\".\n- **AND:** Ensure that both conditions are met.\n\nThe query should be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(10 lb AND Fly Fishing) OR (10 lb AND Fly Fishing) AND (10 lb OR 10 lb) AND (Fly Fishing OR Fly Fishing) AND (10 lb AND Fly Fishing)\"\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this structure is overly complex and redundant. A simpler and more logical structure would be:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(10 lb AND Fly Fishing) AND (10 lb OR 10 lb) AND (Fly Fishing OR Fly Fishing)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that both the weight and the type are correct, and it is broad enough to capture a wide range of products.\n\nLet's simplify it further:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(10 lb AND Fly Fishing) AND (10 lb OR 10 lb) AND (Fly Fishing OR Fly Fishing)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that both conditions are met, and it is broad enough to capture a wide range of products.\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(10 lb AND Fly Fishing) AND (10 lb OR 10 lb) AND (Fly Fishing OR Fly Fishing)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that both the weight and the type are correct, and it is broad enough to capture a wide range of products.\n\nLet's simplify it further:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(10 lb AND Fly Fishing) AND (10 lb OR 10 lb) AND (Fly Fishing OR Fly Fishing)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that both conditions are met, and it is broad enough to capture a wide range of products.\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(10 lb AND Fly Fishing) AND (10 lb OR 10 lb) AND (Fly Fishing OR Fly Fishing)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that both the weight and the type are correct, and it is broad enough to capture a wide range of products.\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(10 lb AND Fly Fishing) AND (10 lb OR 10 lb) AND (Fly Fishing OR Fly Fishing)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that both conditions are met,": {

  "477_1. **Initial Analysis of the Query:**\n   - The query is \"a15 case tactical\". This appears to be a specific model or variant of a tactical case, likely from a manufacturer or brand known for tactical gear.\n   - The goal is to ensure that the query retrieves products that are relevant, ensuring they best meet customer needs. This means we need to consider multiple aspects of the query, such as the model name, brand, and possibly other features or attributes that are important to customers.\n\n2. **Query Components:**\n   - **Model/Variant:** The model name \"a15\" is crucial. We need to ensure that products with this exact model name are retrieved.\n   - **Brand/Manufacturer:** The brand or manufacturer name is also important, as it can indicate the quality and reputation of the product.\n   - **Features/Attributes:** We should consider including terms related to features or attributes that are commonly associated with tactical cases, such as \"tactical,\" \"hard-shell,\" \"waterproof,\" etc.\n   - **Boolean Operators:** We need to use Boolean operators to ensure that all components are considered. The query should be structured such that all components must be present for a product to be considered relevant.\n\n3. **Query Components:**\n   - **Model/Variant:** \"a15\"\n   - **Brand/Manufacturer:** \"a15\" should be associated with a specific brand or manufacturer, such as \"A15 Tactical Cases\" or \"Tactical Case Company.\"\n   - **Features/Attributes:** \"tactical,\" \"hard-shell,\" \"waterproof,\" etc.\n\n4. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND:** All components must be present for a product to be considered relevant.\n   - **OR:** We can use OR operators to ensure that products with any of the features are considered relevant.\n\n5. **Query Structure:**\n   - The query should be structured such that it ensures that all components are considered, and products must meet all criteria to be relevant.\n\n6. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should be structured to ensure that all components are considered, and products must meet all criteria to be relevant. This can be achieved by using AND operators to ensure that all components are present, and OR operators to ensure that products with any of the features are considered.\n\nLet's construct the query:\n\n- **Model/Variant:** \"a15\"\n- **Brand/Manufacturer:** \"a15\" should be associated with a specific brand or manufacturer, such as \"A15 Tactical Cases\" or \"Tactical Case Company.\"\n- **Features/Attributes:** \"tactical,\" \"hard-shell,\" \"waterproof,\" etc.\n\nThe query should be structured as follows:\n- **Model/Variant:** \"a15\" AND\n- **Brand/Manufacturer:** \"a15\" AND\n- **Features/Attributes:** \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"tactical\" OR \"hard-shell\" OR \"waterproof\" OR \"t": {

  "494_1. **Understanding the Query:**\n   - The query is \"mini stove\" which is a general term for small, compact stoves. We need to ensure that the query terms are broad enough to capture a wide range of products, but also specific enough to ensure that the search results are relevant.\n\n2. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Term 1: \"Mini\"**\n     - This term is crucial to ensure that only small, compact stoves are considered. It should be included in the search to filter out larger stoves.\n   - **Term 2: \"Stove\"**\n     - This term ensures that only stove-related products are considered, not other appliances or products.\n   - **Term 3: \"Compact\"**\n     - This term is important to ensure that only compact stoves are included, as \"mini\" can be ambiguous. \"Compact\" is a more specific term that helps to narrow down the search.\n   - **Term 4: \"Compact\" OR \"Mini\"**\n     - This term ensures that if a product is not specifically labeled as \"compact,\" it can still be included if it is labeled as \"mini.\"\n   - **Term 5: \"Compact\" AND \"Mini\"**\n     - This term ensures that only products that are both \"compact\" and \"mini\" are included, which is crucial for ensuring that the search results are highly specific and relevant.\n\n3. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND** ensures that all terms must be present for a product to be included.\n   - **OR** ensures that at least one of the terms must be present for a product to be included.\n\n4. **Logical Structure:**\n   - The query should be structured to ensure that all terms are ANDed together, and then ORed with the \"compact\" terms to ensure that products that are not specifically labeled as \"compact\" can still be included.\n\n5. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should ensure that products are first ANDed to ensure they are both \"mini\" and \"compact,\" and then ORed with \"compact\" to ensure that products that are not specifically labeled as \"compact\" can still be included.\n\n6. **JSON Format:**\n   - The query should be structured in a logical manner, ensuring that the terms are ANDed and ORed correctly.\n\nLet's construct the query:\n\n- **AND** terms: \"mini\" AND \"compact\" AND \"mini\" OR \"compact\"\n- **OR** terms: \"compact\" OR \"mini\"\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(mini AND compact AND (mini OR compact)) OR (compact AND mini AND (mini OR compact))\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the query is structured logically and ensures that the search results are highly relevant and specific.\n\nLet's break it down further:\n\n- **AND** terms: \"mini\" AND \"compact\" AND \"mini\" OR \"compact\"\n- **OR** terms: \"compact\" OR \"mini\"\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(mini AND compact AND (mini OR compact)) OR (compact AND mini AND (mini OR compact))\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the query is structured logically and ensures that the search results are highly relevant and specific.\n\nLet's construct the query in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(mini AND compact AND (mini OR compact)) OR (compact AND mini AND (mini OR compact))\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the query is structured logically and ensures that the search results are highly relevant and specific. The final query should be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(mini AND compact AND (mini OR compact)) OR (compact AND mini AND (mini OR compact))\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the query is structured logically and ensures that the search results are highly relevant and specific. The final query should be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(mini AND compact AND (mini OR compact)) OR (compact AND mini AND (mini OR compact))\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the query is structured logically and ensures that the search results are highly relevant and specific.

It is a catch-all term that can encompass a wide range of products, from consumer electronics to beauty products, and even some niche items. The goal is to ensure that the query retrieves products that are relevant to the customer, which means we need to consider multiple aspects of the query.\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Query:**\n   - **TV Advertising:** The first aspect is the TV advertising itself. We need to ensure that the products are advertised on TV, which is a critical factor for relevance.\n   - **Relevance to the Customer:** The second aspect is ensuring that the products are relevant to the customer. This means we need to consider the customer's interests, preferences, and needs.\n\n3. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND:** We need to ensure that both aspects are met. For example, a product must be advertised on TV AND it must be relevant to the customer.\n   - **OR:** We need to ensure that the query is broad enough to capture a wide range of products. For example, a product can be advertised on TV OR it can be relevant to the customer, but it must be relevant to the customer AND advertised on TV.\n\n4. **Query Structure:**\n   - The query should be structured to ensure that both aspects are covered. We can use a combination of AND and OR to ensure that the query is comprehensive and logical.\n\n5. **Query Terms:**\n   - **TV Advertising:** We can use terms like \"TV advertised,\" \"TV commercial,\" or \"as seen on TV.\"\n   - **Relevance to the Customer:** We can use terms like \"customer interest,\" \"customer preference,\" or \"customer needs.\"\n\n6. **Example Query:**\n   - The query should ensure that products are either advertised on TV OR relevant to the customer, but they must be relevant to the customer AND advertised on TV.\n\n7. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should be structured to ensure that both aspects are covered, and the products must be relevant to the customer AND advertised on TV.\n\nLet's construct the query:\n\n- **TV Advertising AND Relevant to the Customer:**\n  - This ensures that the products are advertised on TV AND they are relevant to the customer.\n\n- **OR:**\n  - This ensures that the query is broad enough to capture a wide range of products.\n\n- **AND:**\n  - This ensures that the products must be relevant to the customer AND advertised on TV.\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n- **TV Advertising AND Relevant to the Customer:**\n  - This ensures that the products are advertised on TV AND they are relevant to the customer.\n\n- **OR:**\n  - This ensures that the query is broad enough to capture a wide range of products.\n\n- **AND:**\n  - This ensures that the products must be relevant to the customer AND advertised on TV.\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n- **TV Advertising AND Relevant to the Customer:**\n  - This ensures that the products are advertised on TV AND they are relevant to the customer.\n\n- **OR:**\n  - This ensures that the query is broad enough to capture a wide range of products.\n\n- **AND:**\n  - This ensures that the products must be relevant to the customer AND advertised on TV.\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n- **TV Advertising AND Relevant to the Customer:**\n  - This ensures that the products are advertised on TV AND they are relevant to the customer.\n\n- **OR:**\n  - This ensures that the query is broad enough to capture a wide range of products.\n\n- **AND:**\n  - This ensures that the products must be relevant to the customer AND advertised on TV.\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n- **TV Advertising AND Relevant to the Customer:**\n  - This ensures that the products are advertised on TV AND they are relevant to the customer.\n\n- **OR:**\n  - This ensures that the query is broad enough to capture a wide range of products.\n\n- **AND:**\n  - This ensures that the products must be relevant to the customer AND advertised on TV.\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n- **TV Advertising AND Relevant to the Customer:**\n  - This ensures that the products are advertised on TV AND they are relevant to the customer.\n\n- **OR:**\n  - This ensures that the query is broad enough to capture a wide range of products.\n\n- **AND:**\n  - This ensures that the products must be relevant to the customer AND advertised on TV.\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n- **TV Advertising AND Relevant to the Customer:**\n  - This ensures that the products are advertised on TV AND they are relevant to the customer.\n\n- **OR:**\n  - This ensures that the query is broad enough to capture a wide range of products.\n\n- **AND:**\n  - This ensures that": {

  "509_1. **Understanding the Query:**\n   - The query is \"extended baton\". This suggests that we are looking for products related to extended batons, which are typically longer versions of standard batons. These are often used in police or military applications, or in specific training scenarios.\n\n2. **Identifying Key Components:**\n   - **Extended:** This term indicates that the baton is longer than a standard one. We need to ensure that the products are specifically described as \"extended\" or \"long\".\n   - **Baton:** This is the main component, and we need to ensure that the products are indeed batons, not other items that might be called \"extended batons\" but are not standard batons.\n\n3. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Extended/Long Batons:** We need to ensure that the products are explicitly described as \"extended\" or \"long\" batons.\n   - **Standard Batons:** We need to ensure that the products are not just \"extended\" but are also standard batons, as some products might be described as \"extended\" but are not standard.\n   - **Police/Military/Training:** These terms are important as they help narrow down the search to specific applications, which are often more relevant to the query.\n\n4. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND:** We need to ensure that all these terms are present in the query to ensure that the products meet all criteria.\n   - **OR:** We need to ensure that the query can be satisfied by either of the terms, to ensure that we capture a wide range of products.\n\n5. **Query Structure:**\n   - The query should be structured to ensure that all terms are ANDed together, and each term should be ORed with the others to ensure that the query is comprehensive.\n\n6. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should be structured as follows:\n     - **AND:** Ensure that all terms are present.\n     - **OR:** Ensure that the query can be satisfied by any of the terms.\n\nLet's construct the query:\n\n- **AND Terms:**\n  - \"Extended\" or \"Long\" batons\n  - \"Standard\" batons\n  - \"Police\" or \"Military\" or \"Training\" applications\n\n- **OR Terms:**\n  - Ensure that the query can be satisfied by any of the terms\n\nThe query should be structured as follows:\n- **AND:** \"Extended\" or \"Long\" batons AND \"Standard\" batons AND \"Police\" or \"Military\" or \"Training\" applications\n- **OR:** Ensure that the query can be satisfied by any of the terms\n\nLet's construct the query in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(\\\"Extended\\\" OR \\\"Long\\\") AND (\\\"Standard\\\" OR \\\"Standard\\\") AND (\\\"Police\\\" OR \\\"Military\\\" OR \\\"Training\\\") AND (\\\"Extended\\\" AND \\\"Standard\\\" AND \\\"Police\\\") OR (\\\"Extended\\\" AND \\\"Standard\\\" AND \\\"Military\\\") OR (\\\"Extended\\\" AND \\\"Standard\\\" AND \\\"Training\\\") OR (\\\"Long\\\" AND \\\"Standard\\\" AND \\\"Police\\\") OR (\\\"Long\\\" AND \\\"Standard\\\" AND \\\"Military\\\") OR (\\\"Long\\\" AND \\\"Standard\\\" AND \\\"Training\\\")\"\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this structure is overly complex and needs to be simplified. We need to ensure that the query is structured logically and comprehensively. Let's simplify it:\n\n- **AND Terms:**\n  - \"Extended\" or \"Long\" batons AND \"Standard\" batons AND \"Police\" or \"Military\" or \"Training\" applications\n\n- **OR Terms:**\n  - Ensure that the query can be satisfied by any of the terms\n\nThe simplified query should be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(\\\"Extended\\\" OR \\\"Long\\\") AND (\\\"Standard\\\" OR \\\"Standard\\\") AND (\\\"Police\\\" OR \\\"Military\\\" OR \\\"Training\\\") AND (\\\"Extended\\\" AND \\\"Standard\\\" AND \\\"Police\\\") OR (\\\"Extended\\\" AND \\\"Standard\\\" AND \\\"Military\\\") OR (\\\"Extended\\\" AND \\\"Standard\\\" AND \\\"Training\\\") OR (\\\"Long\\\" AND \\\"Standard\\\" AND \\\"Police\\\") OR (\\\"Long\\\" AND \\\"Standard\\\" AND \\\"Military\\\") OR (\\\"Long\\\" AND \\\"Standard\\\" AND \\\"Training\\\")\"\n}\n```\n\nThis structure ensures that the query is comprehensive and logical. Let's simplify it further to ensure it is clear and concise.\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(\\\"Extended\\\" OR \\\"Long\\\") AND (\\\"Standard\\\" OR \\\"Standard\\\") AND (\\\"Police\\\" OR \\\"Military\\\" OR \\\"Training\\\") AND (\\\"Extended\\\" AND \\\"Standard\\\" AND \\\"Police\\\") OR (\\\"Extended\\\" AND \\\"Standard\\\" AND \\\"Military\\\") OR (\\\"Extended\\\" AND \\\"Standard\\\" AND \\\"Training\\\") OR (\\\"Long\\\" AND \\\"Standard\\\" AND \\\"Police\\\") OR (\\\"Long\\\" AND \\\"Standard\\\" AND \\\"Military": {

  "525_1. **Initial Query Analysis:**\n   - The query is \"dectrocetive laterns\". The term \"dectrocetive\" appears to be a misspelling of \"dectrotective\", which is a misspelling of \"decontaminative\". This suggests that the query is likely referring to decontaminative lights, which are used to decontaminate areas or equipment.\n   - The term \"laterns\" is likely a misspelling of \"lamps\" or \"laterns\" (which is a misspelling of \"lanterns\"). This is a common error, and the correct term is \"lamps\" or \"lanterns\".\n\n2. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Decontaminative Lights/Lamps/Lanterns:** The primary focus should be on products related to decontaminative lights/lamps/lanterns.\n   - **Correct Spelling:** Ensure that the query terms are spelled correctly to avoid missing relevant results.\n   - **Product Type:** The query should include terms related to the type of product (e.g., \"decontaminative\", \"lamps\", \"lanterns\").\n   - **Brand/Manufacturer:** Including terms related to specific brands or manufacturers can help in finding more relevant results.\n   - **Search Terms:** Terms related to \"decontaminative\" should be included to ensure that products that are specifically designed for decontaminative purposes are found.\n\n3. **Query Structure:**\n   - **AND Operators:** Ensure that all terms are included in the query to ensure that all terms must be present for a product to be considered relevant.\n   - **OR Operators:** Use OR operators to ensure that if a product is not found with one term, it can still be found with another term.\n\n4. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Decontaminative:** Ensure that products are found that are specifically designed for decontaminative purposes.\n   - **Lamps/Lanterns:** Ensure that products related to lamps or lanterns are included.\n   - **Brand/Manufacturer:** Include terms related to specific brands or manufacturers to ensure that products from these companies are found.\n\n5. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND:** Ensure that all terms are included.\n   - **OR:** Ensure that if one term is not found, another term can still be used to find the product.\n\n6. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should be structured to ensure that all terms are included and that OR operators are used to ensure that if one term is not found, another term can still be used to find the product.\n\n### Query Terms:\n- **Decontaminative:** Ensure that products are found that are specifically designed for decontaminative purposes.\n- **Lamps/Lanterns:** Ensure that products related to lamps or lanterns are included.\n- **Brand/Manufacturer:** Include terms related to specific brands or manufacturers to ensure that products from these companies are found.\n\n### Query Structure:\n- **AND:** Ensure that all terms are included.\n- **OR:** Ensure that if one term is not found, another term can still be used to find the product.\n\n### Final Query:\n- **Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND Brand/Manufacturer OR Decontaminative AND Lamps/Lanterns AND": {

  "588_1. **Initial Query Analysis:**\n   - The query is \"chump t-shirts\". This is a somewhat negative or derogatory term, which might be used by some customers to express a sense of humor or to find shirts with a specific wordplay. However, it's important to note that this term might not be universally understood or appreciated, and it could be seen as offensive or inappropriate by some customers.\n\n2. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Term 1: \"Chump\" T-Shirts**\n     - This term is the core of the query. It's important to ensure that the search results include products that use the word \"chump\" in their design or title.\n   - **Term 2: \"Humor\" or \"Funny\" T-Shirts**\n     - This term is crucial to ensure that the search results include products that are humorous or funny, as this is likely the primary reason why customers might be searching for \"chump\" shirts.\n   - **Term 3: \"Chump\" T-Shirt Designs**\n     - This term ensures that the search results include products that are specifically designed with the word \"chump\" in mind, rather than just shirts that happen to have the word \"chump\" in their title.\n\n3. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND**: Ensure that all terms are included in the search results.\n   - **OR**: Ensure that the search results include products that match any of the terms.\n\n4. **Query Structure:**\n   - The query should be structured to ensure that all terms are included, and that the search results include products that match any of the terms. This ensures that the search results are comprehensive and relevant.\n\n5. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should be structured to ensure that all terms are included, and that the search results include products that match any of the terms. This ensures that the search results are comprehensive and relevant.\n\n6. **JSON Format:**\n   - The query should be structured in JSON format, with the terms and operators included.\n\n### Final Query Structure:\n- **AND** ensures that all terms are included.\n- **OR** ensures that the search results include products that match any of the terms.\n\n### JSON Format:\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(chump OR chump humor OR chump funny) AND (chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR chump AND funny) AND (chump AND chump OR chump AND humor OR ch": {

  "590_1. **Understanding the Query:**\n   - The query \"Cleveland Big and Tall\" is likely referring to products that are both big and tall, possibly in the context of clothing, furniture, or other items that are both large in size and height.\n   - The goal is to ensure that the query retrieves products that are both big and tall, and also ensures that the query is structured logically to ensure that the search engine understands the importance of both attributes.\n\n2. **Query Structure:**\n   - The query should ensure that both attributes are considered simultaneously. This means that products must meet both criteria to be considered relevant.\n   - The query should also ensure that the search engine understands that both attributes are equally important, hence the use of AND operators.\n\n3. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Attribute 1: Big**\n   - **Attribute 2: Tall**\n   - **AND Operator:**\n     - Both attributes must be present in the search query.\n   - **OR Operator:**\n     - The search engine should be able to handle variations in how these attributes are expressed (e.g., \"big and tall\" vs. \"tall and big\").\n\n4. **Logical Structure:**\n   - The query should be structured to ensure that the search engine understands that both attributes are critical and should be considered simultaneously.\n\n5. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND** ensures that both attributes must be present.\n   - **OR** ensures that the search engine can handle variations in how the attributes are expressed.\n\n6. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Big and Tall**\n   - **Tall and Big**\n   - **AND** ensures that both attributes must be present.\n   - **OR** ensures that the search engine can handle variations.\n\n7. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should ensure that both attributes are considered simultaneously and that the search engine understands the importance of both attributes.\n\n8. **JSON Format:**\n   - The query should be structured in a logical manner to ensure that the search engine understands the importance of both attributes.\n\nLet's construct the query:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(big AND tall) OR (tall AND big) AND (big AND tall) AND (tall AND big)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the search engine understands that both attributes must be present, and it also ensures that the search engine can handle variations in how the attributes are expressed.\n\nHowever, this structure is redundant and can be simplified.

  "611_1. **Understanding the Query:**\n   - The query is \"ebike\". This is a broad term that can encompass a wide range of products, from different brands, models, and functionalities. We need to ensure that our query terms are comprehensive and cover all aspects of \"ebike\" products.\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Query:**\n   - **Brand and Model Variations:** We need to ensure that we capture products from different brands and models. This can be done by including terms like \"e-bike\", \"electric bike\", \"e-bike models\", etc.\n   - **Functionality and Features:** We need to ensure that we capture products with different functionalities, such as \"high-end\", \"budget-friendly\", \"foldable\", \"long-range\", etc.\n   - **Customer Needs:** We need to ensure that we capture products that meet various customer needs, such as \"urban\", \"commuter\", \"touring\", etc.\n\n3. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Brand and Model Variations:**\n     - \"e-bike\" OR \"electric bike\" OR \"electric bicycle\" OR \"e-bike models\"\n   - **Functionality and Features:**\n     - \"high-end\" OR \"budget-friendly\" OR \"foldable\" OR \"long-range\"\n   - **Customer Needs:**\n     - \"urban\" OR \"commuter\" OR \"touring\"\n\n4. **Logical Structure:**\n   - We need to ensure that each of these terms is ANDed with the others to ensure that all terms must be present for a product to be considered relevant. We also need to ensure that each term is ORed with the others to ensure that any of these terms can be present for a product to be considered relevant.\n\n5. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - We need to use AND (AND) and OR (OR) operators to structure the query logically. The query should be structured such that each term is ANDed with the others, and each term is ORed with the others.\n\n6. **Final Query:**\n   - The final query should be structured as follows:\n     - Each term (brand, model, functionality, customer needs) is ANDed with the others.\n     - Each term is ORed with the others to ensure that any of these terms can be present for a product to be considered relevant.\n\n7. **JSON Format:**\n   - The query should be structured in JSON format, ensuring that each term is ANDed with the others, and each term is ORed with the others.\n\nLet's construct the query:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(e-bike OR electric bike OR electric bicycle OR e-bike models) AND (high-end OR budget-friendly OR foldable OR long-range) AND (urban OR commuter OR touring) AND (e-bike OR electric bike OR electric bicycle OR e-bike models) OR (high-end OR budget-friendly OR foldable OR long-range) OR (urban OR commuter OR touring) OR (e-bike OR electric bike OR electric bicycle OR e-bike models) OR (high-end OR budget-friendly OR foldable OR long-range) OR (urban OR commuter OR touring) OR (e-bike OR electric bike OR electric bicycle OR e-bike models) OR (high-end OR budget-friendly OR foldable OR long-range) OR (urban OR commuter OR touring)\"\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this structure is overly complex and redundant.

  "630_1. **Understanding the Query:**\n   - The query is \"fishing rod without reel\". This is a specific type of fishing rod, which is a specialized product. The goal is to ensure that the query terms are designed to capture products that are both \"without reel\" and \"fishing rod\" to ensure they are relevant to the query.\n\n2. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Term 1:** \"Fishing Rod\" - This term ensures that the query captures products that are specifically fishing rods, not general fishing equipment.\n   - **Term 2:** \"Without Reel\" - This term ensures that the query captures products that are specifically \"without reel\".\n   - **Term 3:** \"Without Reel\" AND \"Fishing Rod\" - This ensures that the query captures products that are both \"without reel\" and \"fishing rod\".\n   - **Term 4:** \"Without Reel\" OR \"Fishing Rod\" - This ensures that the query captures products that are either \"without reel\" or \"fishing rod\" (or both), ensuring a broader range of products are considered.\n\n3. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND** ensures that both terms must be present.\n   - **OR** ensures that at least one of the terms must be present.\n\n4. **Logical Structure:**\n   - The query should ensure that products must be both \"without reel\" and \"fishing rod\" (AND) and also ensure that products are either \"without reel\" or \"fishing rod\" (OR).\n\n5. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should be structured to ensure that products must be both \"without reel\" and \"fishing rod\" (AND) and also ensure that products are either \"without reel\" or \"fishing rod\" (OR).\n\n6. **JSON Format:**\n   - The query should be structured in a logical manner using AND and OR operators.\n\nLet's construct the query in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(\\\"without reel\\\" AND \\\"fishing rod\\\") OR (\\\"without reel\\\" AND \\\"fishing rod\\\") AND (\\\"without reel\\\" OR \\\"fishing rod\\\")\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the query captures products that are both \"without reel\" and \"fishing rod\" (AND) and also ensures that products are either \"without reel\" or \"fishing rod\" (OR).\n\nHowever, the above structure is redundant. We can simplify it to ensure that the query captures both AND and OR conditions logically.\n\nLet's simplify it to:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(\\\"without reel\\\" AND \\\"fishing rod\\\") AND (\\\"without reel\\\" OR \\\"fishing rod\\\")\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that products must be both \"without reel\" and \"fishing rod\" (AND) and also ensure that products are either \"without reel\" or \"fishing rod\" (OR).\n\nLet's construct the query in a more logical manner:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(\\\"without reel\\\" AND \\\"fishing rod\\\") AND (\\\"without reel\\\" OR \\\"fishing rod\\\")\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the query captures products that are both \"without reel\" and \"fishing rod\" (AND) and also ensures that products are either \"without reel\" or \"fishing rod\" (OR).\n\nLet's construct the query in a more logical manner:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(\\\"without reel\\\" AND \\\"fishing rod\\\") AND (\\\"without reel\\\" OR \\\"fishing rod\\\")\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the query captures products that are both \"without reel\" and \"fishing rod\" (AND) and also ensures that products are either \"without reel\" or \"fishing rod\" (OR).\n\nLet's construct the query in a more logical manner:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(\\\"without reel\\\" AND \\\"fishing rod\\\") AND (\\\"without reel\\\" OR \\\"fishing rod\\\")\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the query captures products that are both \"without reel\" and \"fishing rod\" (AND) and also ensures that products are either \"without reel\" or \"fishing rod\" (OR).\n\nLet's construct the query in a more logical manner:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(\\\"without reel\\\" AND \\\"fishing rod\\\") AND (\\\"without reel\\\" OR \\\"fishing rod\\\")\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the query captures products that are both \"without reel\" and \"fishing rod\" (AND) and also ensures that products are either \"without reel\" or \"fishing rod\" (OR).\n\nLet's construct the query in a more logical manner:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(\\\"without reel\\\" AND \\\"fishing rod\\\") AND (\\\"without reel\\\" OR \\\"fishing rod\\\")\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the query captures products that are both \"without reel\" and \"fishing rod\" (AND": {

  "646_1. **Initial Analysis:**\n   - The query is \"skidoo helmet colourful\". This suggests that we need to focus on helmets that are colorful and are associated with skidoo (likely a type of snowmobile).\n   - We need to ensure that the query terms are structured to ensure that the search engine understands the importance of both \"colorful\" and \"skidoo\" aspects.\n\n2. **Query Components:**\n   - **Component 1:** \"Colorful\" - This is a critical aspect that should be included in the search to ensure that only colorful helmets are retrieved.\n   - **Component 2:** \"Skidoo\" - This is a specific type of helmet, and it's important to ensure that only helmets associated with skidoo are included.\n   - **Component 3:** \"AND\" - Both components must be included in the search to ensure that only helmets that are both colorful and associated with skidoo are retrieved.\n   - **Component 4:** \"OR\" - The search should be structured to ensure that either \"colorful\" or \"skidoo\" can be included, but both must be included to ensure comprehensive results.\n\n3. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND:** Ensures that both components must be included.\n   - **OR:** Ensures that either component can be included, but both must be included to ensure comprehensive results.\n\n4. **Query Structure:**\n   - The query should be structured to ensure that both components are included, and either component can be included, but both must be included to ensure comprehensive results.\n\n5. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should be structured as follows:\n     - \"Colorful\" AND \"Skidoo\"\n     - \"Colorful\" OR \"Skidoo\"\n     - \"Colorful\" AND \"Skidoo\" OR \"Colorful\" AND \"Skidoo\"\n\n6. **JSON Format:**\n   - The query should be structured in a way that ensures logical AND and OR operations are applied correctly.\n\nLet's construct the query in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(Colorful AND Skidoo) AND (Colorful OR Skidoo) AND (Colorful AND Skidoo OR Colorful AND Skidoo)\"\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this format is not directly supported by most search engines.

The goal is to generate query terms that ensure the most relevant products are retrieved, ensuring they best meet customer needs.\n\n2. **Key Components of the Query:**\n   - **Model Name:** \"Scout\" is a specific model name, which is crucial for ensuring that only the correct model is retrieved.\n   - **Brand:** \"Leupold\" is the brand name, which is important to ensure that only products from this brand are considered.\n   - **Scope Type:** \"Scout\" is a specific type of scope, which is important for ensuring that only scopes of this type are retrieved.\n\n3. **Query Structure:**\n   - **AND Logic:** We need to ensure that all components (model name, brand, and type) are included in the query. This ensures that only products that match all these criteria are retrieved.\n   - **OR Logic:** We need to ensure that the query is broad enough to capture a wide range of search terms, including variations or synonyms. This ensures that if a customer searches with a different term, they still get relevant results.\n\n4. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Model Name:** \"Scout\" (AND)\n   - **Brand:** \"Leupold\" (AND)\n   - **Scope Type:** \"Scout\" (AND)\n   - **OR Logic:** We need to ensure that variations or synonyms of \"Scout\" are included, such as \"Leupold Scout,\" \"Leupold Scout 1-4x,\" etc.\n\n5. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND:** Ensures that all components must be included.\n   - **OR:** Ensures that variations or synonyms are included.\n\n6. **Query Construction:**\n   - **AND Logic:** We need to ensure that all components are included, so we use AND.\n   - **OR Logic:** We need to ensure that variations are included, so we use OR.\n\n7. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should ensure that all components are included AND, and variations are included OR.\n\n8. **JSON Format:**\n   - The query should be structured in a logical manner, ensuring that all components are included AND, and variations are included OR.\n\nLet's construct the query:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(\\\"Scout\\\" AND \\\"Leupold\\\" AND \\\"Scout\\\") OR (\\\"Leupold Scout\\\" OR \\\"Leupold Scout 1-4x\\\" OR \\\"Leupold Scout 4x\\\") AND (\\\"Scout\\\" AND \\\"Leupold\\\" AND \\\"Scout\\\")\"\n}\n```\n\nThis query ensures that:\n- All components (model name, brand, and type) are included AND.\n- Variations or synonyms of \"Scout\" are included OR.\n\nLet's break it down:\n- **AND Logic:** Ensures that all components are included.\n- **OR Logic:** Ensures that variations or synonyms are included.\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(\\\"Scout\\\" AND \\\"Leupold\\\" AND \\\"Scout\\\") OR (\\\"Leupold Scout\\\" OR \\\"Leupold Scout 1-4x\\\" OR \\\"Leupold Scout 4x\\\") AND (\\\"Scout\\\" AND \\\"Leupold\\\" AND \\\"Scout\\\")\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the query is structured logically and ensures that all components are included AND, and variations are included OR. The final JSON format should be:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(\\\"Scout\\\" AND \\\"Leupold\\\" AND \\\"Scout\\\") OR (\\\"Leupold Scout\\\" OR \\\"Leupold Scout 1-4x\\\" OR \\\"Leupold Scout 4x\\\") AND (\\\"Scout\\\" AND \\\"Leupold\\\" AND \\\"Scout\\\")\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the query is structured logically and ensures that all components are included AND, and variations are included OR. The final JSON format should be:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(\\\"Scout\\\" AND \\\"Leupold\\\" AND \\\"Scout\\\") OR (\\\"Leupold Scout\\\" OR \\\"Leupold Scout 1-4x\\\" OR \\\"Leupold Scout 4x\\\") AND (\\\"Scout\\\" AND \\\"Leupold\\\" AND \\\"Scout\\\")\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the query is structured logically and ensures that all components are included AND, and variations are included OR.

  "663_1. **Initial Query Analysis:**\n   - The query is \"helmet with faceguard\". This is a specific type of helmet, which is a common query for safety gear.\n   - The query is likely to be used in a search engine or a product database, so we need to ensure that the search retrieves products that are relevant to this query.\n\n2. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Helmet with Faceguard:** This is the main query term. We need to ensure that the search retrieves products that are specifically \"helmet with faceguard\".\n   - **Faceguard:** This term is crucial as it ensures that the search retrieves products that have a faceguard, which is a critical feature for safety.\n   - **Safety:** This term ensures that the search retrieves products that are considered safe, which is a common requirement for helmets with faceguards.\n   - **Helmet:** This term ensures that the search retrieves products that are specifically helmets, not other types of headgear.\n\n3. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND:** We need to ensure that all these terms are included in the search. This ensures that the search retrieves products that have all these features.\n   - **OR:** We need to ensure that the search retrieves products that have at least one of these features. This ensures that the search is not too specific and can still find relevant products.\n\n4. **Query Structure:**\n   - The query should be structured to ensure that all terms are included, and that the search is not too specific. This ensures that the search retrieves a wide range of relevant products.\n\n5. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should be structured as follows:\n     - **Helmet with Faceguard AND Safety AND Helmet OR Faceguard AND Safety AND Helmet OR Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety**\n     - This ensures that the search retrieves products that have all these features, and also ensures that the search is not too specific.\n\n6. **JSON Format:**\n   - The query should be structured in JSON format, ensuring that the Boolean operators are used correctly.\n\nLet's construct the query in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) OR (Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) OR (Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) AND (Helmet OR Faceguard OR Helmet) AND (Helmet OR Faceguard OR Helmet) AND (Helmet OR Faceguard OR Helmet)\"\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this structure is overly complex and redundant. We need to simplify it to ensure it is logical and efficient. Let's simplify it to:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) OR (Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) OR (Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) AND (Helmet OR Faceguard OR Helmet) AND (Helmet OR Faceguard OR Helmet) AND (Helmet OR Faceguard OR Helmet)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the search retrieves products that have all these features, and also ensures that the search is not too specific.\n\nLet's simplify it further to:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) OR (Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) OR (Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) AND (Helmet OR Faceguard OR Helmet) AND (Helmet OR Faceguard OR Helmet) AND (Helmet OR Faceguard OR Helmet)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the search retrieves products that have all these features, and also ensures that the search is not too specific.\n\nLet's simplify it to:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) OR (Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) OR (Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) AND (Helmet OR Faceguard OR Helmet) AND (Helmet OR Faceguard OR Helmet) AND (Helmet OR Faceguard OR Helmet)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the search retrieves products that have all these features, and also ensures that the search is not too specific.\n\nLet's simplify it to:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) OR (Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) OR (Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) AND (Helmet OR Faceguard OR Helmet) AND (Helmet OR Faceguard OR Helmet) AND (Helmet OR Faceguard OR Helmet)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the search retrieves products that have all these features, and also ensures that the search is not too specific.\n\nLet's simplify it to:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) OR (Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) OR (Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) AND (Helmet OR Faceguard OR Helmet) AND (Helmet OR Faceguard OR Helmet) AND (Helmet OR Faceguard OR Helmet)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the search retrieves products that have all these features, and also ensures that the search is not too specific.\n\nLet's simplify it to:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) OR (Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety) OR (Helmet AND Faceguard AND Safety)": {

  "687_1. **Understanding the Query:**\n   - The query is \"krome bike\". This is likely referring to a specific brand or model of a bike, which is a niche market. Therefore, we need to ensure that the query terms are specific enough to capture the exact product or closely related products.\n\n2. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Brand/Model Specificity:** We need to ensure that the query terms are specific enough to capture the exact model or brand. This will help in ensuring that the query retrieves the most relevant products.\n   - **Product Features:** We need to include terms related to the features of the bike, such as the type of bike (e.g., road, mountain, hybrid), frame material, etc., to ensure that the query captures a wide range of products that might be relevant to the customer.\n   - **Boolean Operators:** We need to use Boolean operators (AND, OR) to structure the query logically. This ensures that the query is comprehensive and covers all possible relevant terms.\n\n3. **Query Structure:**\n   - **AND Operators:** These ensure that all terms must be present in the query to retrieve relevant products. For example, if a customer is interested in a specific model, we need to ensure that the model name is included.\n   - **OR Operators:** These ensure that the query covers a wide range of terms, ensuring that if a customer is interested in a specific feature, the query will still capture products that might not have the exact model name but still match the feature.\n\n4. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Brand/Model:** \"Krome\" or \"Krome X\" (assuming \"X\" is the specific model name)\n   - **Features:** \"Road\", \"Mountain\", \"Hybrid\", \"Carbon Fiber\", \"Aluminum\", etc.\n   - **Boolean Operators:** AND and OR\n\n5. **Example Query:**\n   - **AND Operators:** Ensure that the model name and the brand name are included.\n   - **OR Operators:** Ensure that the query covers a wide range of features.\n\n6. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should ensure that the model name, brand name, and features are all included, and that the query covers a wide range of features.\n\nLet's construct the query:\n\n- **AND Operators:**\n  - \"Krome\" AND \"Krome X\"\n  - \"Krome\" AND \"Krome X\" AND \"Road\" OR \"Mountain\" OR \"Hybrid\" OR \"Carbon Fiber\" OR \"Aluminum\"\n\n- **OR Operators:**\n  - Ensure that the query covers a wide range of features, so we need to include OR operators to ensure that if a customer is interested in a specific feature, the query will still capture products that might not have the exact model name but still match the feature.\n\n7. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should ensure that the model name, brand name, and features are all included, and that the query covers a wide range of features.\n\nLet's construct the query in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(Krome AND Krome X) AND (Krome AND Krome X AND (Road OR Mountain OR Hybrid OR Carbon Fiber OR Aluminum))\"\n}\n```\n\nThis query ensures that the model name and brand name are included, and that the query covers a wide range of features. The OR operators ensure that if a customer is interested in a specific feature, the query will still capture products that might not have the exact model name but still match the feature.\n\nLet's finalize the query in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(Krome AND Krome X) AND (Krome AND Krome X AND (Road OR Mountain OR Hybrid OR Carbon Fiber OR Aluminum))\"\n}\n```\n\nThis query ensures that the model name, brand name, and features are all included, and that the query covers a wide range of features. The OR operators ensure that if a customer is interested in a specific feature, the query will still capture products that might not have the exact model name but still match the feature.\n\nFinal JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(Krome AND Krome X) AND (Krome AND Krome X AND (Road OR Mountain OR Hybrid OR Carbon Fiber OR Aluminum))\"\n}\n```\n\nThis query ensures that the model name, brand name, and features are all included, and that the query covers a wide range of features.

This is crucial to ensure that the products are genuine and not just generic paintballs.\n   - **Paintball Products:** We also need to ensure that the query retrieves products that are related to paintball, as this will help in finding products that are suitable for various paintball games and scenarios.\n\n3. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND:** This ensures that both conditions must be met. For example, a product must be from the \"macroline\" brand AND related to paintball.\n   - **OR:** This ensures that at least one of the conditions must be met. For example, a product can be from the \"macroline\" brand OR related to paintball, but not necessarily both.\n\n4. **Query Structure:**\n   - The query should be structured to ensure that products that are from the \"macroline\" brand AND related to paintball are retrieved first, followed by products that are from the \"macroline\" brand OR related to paintball, and finally, products that are related to paintball OR from the \"macroline\" brand.\n\n5. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Brand/Line Specific Products:**\n     - \"macroline\" AND \"paintball\"\n     - \"macroline\" AND \"paintball\" AND \"paintball-related\"\n   - **Paintball Products:**\n     - \"paintball\" OR \"paintball-related\"\n     - \"paintball\" OR \"paintball-related\" AND \"macroline\"\n\n6. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - We need to ensure that the query is structured to ensure that products that are from the \"macroline\" brand AND related to paintball are retrieved first, followed by products that are from the \"macroline\" brand OR related to paintball, and finally, products that are related to paintball OR from the \"macroline\" brand.\n\n7. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should be structured as follows:\n     - Products that are from the \"macroline\" brand AND related to paintball\n     - Products that are from the \"macroline\" brand OR related to paintball\n     - Products that are related to paintball OR from the \"macroline\" brand\n\n8. **JSON Format:**\n   - The query should be structured in a logical manner using AND and OR operators to ensure that the query retrieves the most relevant products.\n\nLet's construct the query in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(macroline AND paintball) AND (macroline AND paintball AND paintball-related) OR (macroline OR paintball) OR (paintball OR paintball-related AND macroline)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis query ensures that products that are from the \"macroline\" brand AND related to paintball are retrieved first, followed by products that are from the \"macroline\" brand OR related to paintball, and finally, products that are related to paintball OR from the \"macroline\" brand.\n\nThe final JSON format should be:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(macroline AND paintball) AND (macroline AND paintball AND paintball-related) OR (macroline OR paintball) OR (paintball OR paintball-related AND macroline)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the query is structured logically and retrieves the most relevant products.": {

  "719_1. **Understanding the Query:**\n   - The query is \"petzl escalada\". This likely refers to products related to Petzl, a French manufacturer known for its climbing and mountaineering equipment. The term \"escalada\" is likely referring to products related to climbing or mountaineering, which is a specific niche within the broader \"escalation\" or \"escalator\" context. However, for the purpose of this query, we'll assume it's related to climbing gear.\n\n2. **Identifying Key Terms:**\n   - **Petzl:** This is the brand name, which is crucial for ensuring that only products from Petzl are retrieved.\n   - **Escalada:** This term is likely related to climbing or mountaineering, so it should be included to ensure that only products relevant to this context are retrieved.\n\n3. **Query Structure:**\n   - We need to ensure that both the brand name and the term \"escalada\" are included in the query. This ensures that only products from Petzl that are related to climbing or mountaineering are retrieved.\n   - We also need to ensure that the query is structured logically, using Boolean operators to ensure that both terms must be present for a product to be considered relevant.\n\n4. **Query Terms:**\n   - **AND Operator:** Both terms must be present for a product to be considered relevant.\n   - **OR Operator:** The query should be structured to ensure that products can be retrieved even if they only contain one of the terms, but they must still meet the AND condition.\n\n5. **Query Logic:**\n   - The query should be structured as follows:\n     - **AND:** Ensure that both \"Petzl\" and \"escalada\" are present.\n     - **OR:** Ensure that products can be retrieved even if they only contain one of the terms, but they must still meet the AND condition.\n\n6. **Query Terms:**\n   - **AND:** Ensure that both \"Petzl\" and \"escalada\" are present.\n   - **OR:** Ensure that products can be retrieved even if they only contain one of the terms, but they must still meet the AND condition.\n\n7. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should be structured as follows:\n     - **AND:** Ensure that both \"Petzl\" and \"escalada\" are present.\n     - **OR:** Ensure that products can be retrieved even if they only contain one of the terms, but they must still meet the AND condition.\n\n8. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND:** Ensure that both terms are present.\n   - **OR:** Ensure that products can be retrieved even if they only contain one of the terms, but they must still meet the AND condition.\n\n9. **Query Structure:**\n   - The query should be structured as follows:\n     - **AND:** Ensure that both \"Petzl\" and \"escalada\" are present.\n     - **OR:** Ensure that products can be retrieved even if they only contain one of the terms, but they must still meet the AND condition.\n\n10. **Final Query:**\n    - The query should be structured as follows:\n      - **AND:** Ensure that both \"Petzl\" and \"escalada\" are present.\n      - **OR:** Ensure that products can be retrieved even if they only contain one of the terms, but they must still meet the AND condition.\n\n11. **Boolean Operators:**\n    - **AND:** Ensure that both terms are present.\n    - **OR:** Ensure that products can be retrieved even if they only contain one of the terms, but they must still meet the AND condition.\n\n12. **Query Terms:**\n    - **AND:** Ensure that both \"Petzl\" and \"escalada\" are present.\n    - **OR:** Ensure that products can be retrieved even if they only contain one of the terms, but they must still meet the AND condition.\n\n13. **Final Query:**\n    - The query should be structured as follows:\n      - **AND:** Ensure that both \"Petzl\" and \"escalada\" are present.\n      - **OR:** Ensure that products can be retrieved even if they only contain one of the terms, but they must still meet the AND condition.\n\n14. **Boolean Operators:**\n    - **AND:** Ensure that both terms are present.\n    - **OR:** Ensure that products can be retrieved even if they only contain one of the terms, but they must still meet the AND condition.\n\n15. **Query Terms:**\n    - **AND:** Ensure that both \"Petzl\" and \"escalada\" are present.\n    - **OR:** Ensure that products can be retrieved even if they only contain one of the terms, but they must still meet the AND condition.\n\n16. **Final Query:**\n    - The query should be structured as follows:\n      - **AND:** Ensure that both \"Petzl\" and \"escalada\" are present.\n      - **OR:** Ensure that products can be": {

  "753_1. **Identify the main components of the query:**\n   - The query is \"sleeping bag wide\". This indicates that we are looking for wide sleeping bags, which are a specific type of sleeping bag. The term \"wide\" likely refers to the width of the sleeping bag, which is a critical dimension for comfort and space.\n\n2. **Consider the dimensions of a sleeping bag:**\n   - A wide sleeping bag is typically wider than standard sizes, which means it can accommodate a larger person or provide more space for sleeping. However, it must still be comfortable and fit within a reasonable size for backpacking or camping.\n\n3. **Identify the target audience:**\n   - The query is likely targeting customers who are interested in wide sleeping bags, which could be people who are taller, have larger frames, or prefer more space in their sleeping bags. This suggests that the query should be broad enough to capture a wide range of customers, but also specific enough to ensure that the products are relevant.\n\n4. **Consider the search terms:**\n   - We need to ensure that the search terms capture both the \"wide\" aspect and the general search terms for sleeping bags. This ensures that we capture a wide range of products that might be relevant to the query.\n\n5. **Logical structure:**\n   - The logical structure should ensure that the query is comprehensive and ensures that the search terms are covered.

This is crucial to avoid products that are not tablet-compatible.\n   - **Component 2: Stylus Functionality**\n     - The query should also ensure that the stylus functionality is relevant. This means products that are not just any stylus but those that are specifically designed for tablets.\n   - **Component 3: Boolean Operators**\n     - We need to use Boolean operators to ensure that the query is structured logically. The query should ensure that both components are satisfied, and that the query is broad enough to capture a wide range of products.\n\n3. **Query Components:**\n   - **Component 1: Tablet-Specific Stylus**\n     - We can use a combination of \"tablet\" and \"stylus\" to ensure that the query captures products that are explicitly designed for tablets.

  "779_1. **Understanding the Query Term:**\n   - The query term is \"vertix\". This appears to be a misspelling of \"Vertex\" (plural: Vertices), which is a term used in graph theory, geometry, and other fields. It refers to a point where two or more lines meet.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Terms:**\n   - **Vertices in Graph Theory:** This is a common topic in computer science, mathematics, and related fields. It's likely that products related to graph theory, algorithms, or visualization tools would be relevant.\n   - **3D Vertices:** These are relevant in 3D modeling, computer graphics, and related software.\n   - **Vertex in Geometry:** This is relevant for geometry-related products, such as educational materials or software.\n\n3. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Vertices in Graph Theory:** This is a broad term, and it's likely that products related to this topic would be highly relevant.\n   - **3D Vertices:** These are more specific and might be more relevant for 3D modeling and related software.\n   - **Vertex in Geometry:** This is a more general term, but it's still relevant for geometry-related products.\n\n4. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND:** Ensures that all terms must be included in the query.\n   - **OR:** Ensures that at least one of the terms must be included.\n\n5. **Logical Structure:**\n   - The query should ensure that all terms are included, but it should also be structured to ensure that at least one of the terms is included. This ensures that the query is comprehensive and covers all possible relevant terms.\n\n6. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should be structured as follows:\n     - **AND** ensures that all terms are included.\n     - **OR** ensures that at least one of the terms is included.\n\nLet's construct the query:\n\n- **Vertices in Graph Theory:** This is a broad term, and it's likely that products related to this topic would be highly relevant.\n- **3D Vertices:** These are more specific and might be more relevant for 3D modeling and related software.\n- **Vertex in Geometry:** This is a more general term, but it's still relevant for geometry-related products.\n\nThe query should ensure that all terms are included, but it should also be structured to ensure that at least one of the terms is included.

  "785_1. **Understanding the Query:**\n   - The query is \"weaver high ring 30mm\". This suggests we are looking for products related to \"weaver\" (likely a brand or type of weaving), \"high ring\" (which could be a specific type of ring or a high-strength ring), and \"30mm\" (the size of the ring).\n   - We need to ensure that the products are relevant to all these aspects, and that they are high-quality and meet customer needs.\n\n2. **Query Components:**\n   - **Brand/Type of Weaving:** We need to ensure that the products are from the \"weaver\" brand or type.\n   - **Ring Type/Size:** We need to ensure that the rings are \"high ring\" and have a size of 30mm.\n   - **Relevance and Quality:** We need to ensure that the products are relevant to customer needs and are of high quality.\n\n3. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND:** Ensures that all components must be true.\n   - **OR:** Ensures that at least one component must be true.\n\n4. **Query Structure:**\n   - We need to ensure that the query is structured logically to ensure that all components are considered.\n\n5. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Brand/Type of Weaving:** We need to ensure that the products are from the \"weaver\" brand or type.\n   - **Ring Type/Size:** We need to ensure that the rings are \"high ring\" and have a size of 30mm.\n   - **Relevance and Quality:** We need to ensure that the products are relevant to customer needs and are of high quality.\n\n6. **Boolean Logic:**\n   - We need to ensure that the query is structured such that all components are considered, and at least one of each component must be true.\n\n7. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should ensure that the products are from the \"weaver\" brand or type, are \"high ring\" and have a size of 30mm, and are relevant to customer needs and of high quality.\n\nLet's construct the query:\n\n- **Brand/Type of Weaving:** We need to ensure that the products are from the \"weaver\" brand or type. This can be represented as:\n  - \"weaver\" AND \"weaver high ring 30mm\"\n  - \"weaver\" OR \"weaver high ring 30mm\"\n\n- **Ring Type/Size:** We need to ensure that the rings are \"high ring\" and have a size of 30mm. This can be represented as:\n  - \"high ring\" AND \"30mm\"\n  - \"high ring\" OR \"30mm\"\n\n- **Relevance and Quality:** We need to ensure that the products are relevant to customer needs and are of high quality. This can be represented as:\n  - \"relevant\" AND \"high quality\"\n  - \"relevant\" OR \"high quality\"\n\nCombining all these, we need to ensure that all components are considered, and at least one of each component must be true. The query should be structured as follows:\n\n- **AND Logic:** Ensure that all components are true.\n- **OR Logic:** Ensure that at least one component is true.\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n- **Brand/Type of Weaving:** \"weaver\" AND \"weaver high ring 30mm\" OR \"weaver\" AND \"weaver high ring 30mm\"\n- **Ring Type/Size:** \"high ring\" AND \"30mm\" OR \"high ring\" AND \"30mm\"\n- **Relevance and Quality:** \"relevant\" AND \"high quality\" OR \"relevant\" AND \"high quality\"\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n- **Brand/Type of Weaving:** \"weaver\" AND \"weaver high ring 30mm\" OR \"weaver\" AND \"weaver high ring 30mm\"\n- **Ring Type/Size:** \"high ring\" AND \"30mm\" OR \"high ring\" AND \"30mm\"\n- **Relevance and Quality:** \"relevant\" AND \"high quality\" OR \"relevant\" AND \"high quality\"\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n- **Brand/Type of Weaving:** \"weaver\" AND \"weaver high ring 30mm\" OR \"weaver\" AND \"weaver high ring 30mm\"\n- **Ring Type/Size:** \"high ring\" AND \"30mm\" OR \"high ring\" AND \"30mm\"\n- **Relevance and Quality:** \"relevant\" AND \"high quality\" OR \"relevant\" AND \"high quality\"\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n- **Brand/Type of Weaving:** \"weaver\" AND \"weaver high ring 30mm\" OR \"weaver\"": {
