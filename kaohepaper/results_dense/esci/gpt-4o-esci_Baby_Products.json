However, since the brand \"samxic\" is already specified, the query is quite targeted. Expanding with too many additional terms might dilute the specificity. Instead, we can add a couple of popular features that are generally important to consumers looking for baby monitors.\n\nTherefore, a query expansion with \"video\", \"audio\", and \"Wi-Fi connectivity\" can provide a balanced approach, helping to retrieve products that offer a good set of features while still focusing on the \"samxic\" brand.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n{\n    \"query\": \"samxic baby monitor video audio Wi-Fi connectivity\"\n}\n</answer>",
