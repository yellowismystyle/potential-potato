Harvest Love is about a woman who find herself again when she goes home for a vacation. The love story has the usual conflict at the start but the characters fall in love slowly and with a lot of restraint. No kissing until right at the end! Made me want to try pear desserts. Harvest Love is very innocent but has a little romantic dancing at a festival. I'd say it should be rated PG for this.<br /><br />Pumpkin Pie Wars was really cute and I loved that the women in the movie all ended up friends again in the end. Basically you have two best friends who have a falling out and it takes years for them to even speak to each other again. The happy ending in this can't be beat! Plus lots of baking competitions and romance. A little kissing but that is it.<br /><br />Truly Madly Sweetly made me feel uncomfortable for the most part because the characters were always in conflict. While the ending is happy I just felt like I would probably not watch it again. I don't mind when characters don't like each other at the start, but to be fighting for different goals basically the whole movie was not as enjoyable to watch. I also wondered what would really happen in their circumstance if the ex wife decided she wanted her husband back. It all felt a bit too risky for me.<br /><br />But no violence, swearing or anything objectionable in any of the movies. The G rating seems true for the last two of the movies at least. PG for Harvest Love.<br /><br />And I must admit my big strong husband came and sat right next to me while I was watching Harvest Love. These movies are enjoyable for men to watch too. Apparently. ;)))) He watched all three. But his question was...\"Why are all these movies the same just with different actors?\" I told him they are just what women love to watch over and over again. It is the romance we crave. So we enjoy watching two characters fall in love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review", "images": [], "asin": "B0948NMZ1F", "parent_asin": "B0948NMZ1F", "user_id": "AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA", "timestamp": 1637374784203, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}}

There are things I really like about it and things that I don\u2019t.<br />I bought it in the shade 04 Honey. In the bottle it looks like an almost exact match to my skin, but when I put it on it\u2019s much paler with a decidedly pink undertone, yet it doesn\u2019t look orange or too pink in my skin. I prefer a neutral undertone though since my skin can be both yellow and pink.<br /><br />I love the bottle and packaging. It comes in a frosted glass bottle with a pink pump and pink cap that snaps on tightly.<br /><br />The coverage is much higher than I expected and it is heavier than expected for a luminous foundation.<br /><br />It covers blue tones better than redness. I have typically had to build it up in areas I have more redness (and we\u2019re talking average redness, not anything extreme) and doing this makes it look much heavier so I end up using a concealer instead. The problem with this lies in the finish.<br /><br />So this foundation\u2019s finish is very confusing and hard to describe. It is very glowy and luminous without being shimmery but it has the heaviness of a matte. I know, confusing.<br />Areas can look too greasy or too dry. It settles into fine lines and creases around the eyes and nostrils. For this reason this is not a foundation I choose for the daytime. It\u2019s much too heavy and shiny for the day, which is a shame because I enjoy it\u2019s longevity. Once I set it with some powder around the eyes and my nostrils I really enjoy it for a night out.<br /><br />I should also mention it is heavily perfumed with a floral scent so those sensitive to scented foundations will likely want to give this a pass. It\u2019s not bothersome to me personally but fragrance can irritate really sensitive skin.<br /><br />All in all I don\u2019t use it as much as I hoped I would and probably won\u2019t repurchase based on that and how heavy it is. At 36 I want a foundation with decent coverage but a lighter feel. It\u2019s also not the easiest foundation to completely remove and when I wear it I have to use a cleaning oil and a cleanser both AND a miceller solution.<br /><br />I have combo skin that can be prone to breakouts with certain brands but I haven\u2019t broken out from this foundation.<br /><br />I enjoy Holika Holika\u2019s BB cream which is why I gave this a shot (and I like a luminous foundation) but I\u2019ll probably stick with the BB cream in the future since it\u2019s lighter.", "images": [], "asin": "B07KXHWB9D", "parent_asin": "B07KXHWB9D", "user_id": "AEYFVB4VV6K3FGS463K6Z7RM7NSQ", "timestamp": 1567820596035, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}}

We ordered this to compliment my daughter's Mad Hatter Halloween costume and honestly, it looked like a hot mess when it arrived.  The bangs were going everywhere, the curls were tangled, there was no part...it was awful.<br /><br />My daughter, who is 12, has long, VERY thick blonde hair.  When the wig arrived, we tried it on with her hair down to make sure it fit.  It did.  Fast forward to Halloween...I braided her hair and pulled it into a knot at the back of her head.  Lo and behold, the wig wouldn't fit...it just kept sliding off her head.  That was my mistake...I should have tested it with a bun when it arrived.  Having said that, my daughter is incredibly petite...her doctor predicts she won't surpass 5' when she's full grown  Obviously, her head isn't that large.  My point?  If you're an adult or are purchasing this for a teen or big child, it likely won't fit.  I finally had to put her hair in a low bun at the nape of her neck to make it work.<br /><br />Unfortunately, because her natural hair was so low, we couldn't do the up-do we had planned because her bun showed if we did.  We ended up leaving it down, brushing it out, putting bobby pins in strategic places to help it frame her face and to contain it, and then I hair sprayed it in place.  Styling was especially difficult because the wig is sparse.  It's a lot of work to hide the netting underneath.  The netting is a yellow-beige color and stands out like bright white against the purple and teal.  We finally got it looking decent though, and she actually got many compliments on it throughout the evening, hence the higher star rating despite all the complaints.<br /><br />Once the wig was brushed and styled, the waves looked beautiful.

It sheds a bit but all units have some shedding. For the mix brown I give 4 stars.The face front is about 2 inches and is meant to be cut and plucked for a natural look. I did neither in the photo. I just folded it under the the front as I'm afraid that cutting will make it look lifted in the front and obviously show it's a wig without some glue to put it down. The color is not exactly what I wanted. I was hoping it would be a darker brown. It's kinda a mousey brown and alittle strange in my opinion. It will need to be restyle in the front as some waves/curls flattened out by how it was packed in transport. The part is both a plastic fake skin and a mesh on top. You can see the mesh upon close examination. Makeup might help to conceal this.... Or make it worse. What I did like was the fullness and length. The weft was not too easy to be seen even when pulling hair apart. This is good compared to other brands where the wefts are often very visible, especially in the back and crown of a unit. Because the simulated scalp is narrow, you won't be able to change the part. It's also a bit flat near the part so it's gonna take some work to give a bit of volume. I would have enjoyed this much more had the color been a rich brown and if the scalp was a bit more realistic. Would I wear in public? Probably not. Would this be good for photo shoots or costumes ? yes. Would I buy other colors from this brand? Yes and I haven't done that with other brands on Amazon. For the purple ombre: I give 3 stars. It doesn't have the lace in front. This is more pure costume. The black is very shiney and the front of wig where the part is shows a bit of the black backing for construction. If it laid more flat and had the lace I would have given the purple ombre 4 stars. Dull the shiney with some powder like dry shampoo or maybe even dark eyeshadow. The fake scalp is actually better on the purple ombre compared to the brown mix. The ombre for the blonde is also a 4 star. Hair at the crown is a bit flat but the rest of the style is beautiful. The brown to blonde has the 2 inch lace like the long brown one. It's not as full on the head but you don't see the wefts unless you pull it apart a bit.  I feel the color is much more realistic. Hair feels pretty good for a synthetic. Note if you play too much , it will get a knotty feel. Again, good for photos. Some people might actually wear it daily but I don't know if it took take daily abuse.

I also like that it has a fantastic cool toned set of colors that do not end up showing up blue or purple on the skin. The undertones are very subtle, just like real skin! So hard to find - there seems to be a profusion of warm toned makeup out there, but very little cool or neutral toned makeup that produces a smooth, natural looking and flattering gradient of color on the skin.

I spritz some conditioner and water on the hair and that did not make any difference.<br /><br />Everyone knows this..<br />When you use conditioner and water on curly human hair it\u2019s gets more curly but that wasn\u2019t the case for this hair.. and I know this for sure because I have bought more than 5 curly human hair wigs on Amazon and all of them feat curly with water or conditioner.<br /><br />Now, this is definitely not the wig in the pictures.<br />Most of these sellers on amazon takes pictures from those professionals stylists on Instagram and use it to sell their products.<br /><br />The color is far from the one in the picture.<br /><br />In the video, that\u2019s after the hair is being washed, and you can see I\u2019m spraying water on it and nothings happen..

I have 3B style curls and I'm also biracial so my hair is really porous and a bit on the fragile side. In its curly state it's a pain to care for but the traditional blow dry and flat iron method is both tedious and damaging to my hair.<br /><br />When wet to straight irons came out, I immediately hopped on board because it just made more sense that heating my hair while wet would be less damaging to it. Through this I got hooked lol. But even with that it is a bit tedious.... though it did help me figure out that I could flat iron my hair dry and skip the blow dryer.<br /><br />My boyfriend has one of these brushes and I tried it as a quick way to straighten my hair in the am. I was SUPER impressed! But it had some design flaws that made me seek my own, and landed me here.<br /><br />From what I've seen comparing this brush to the more popular Rinfy and his brush, they've reallly improved upon the original design concepts. Most notably, the buttons are on the front of the handle and not the sides, down near the cord instead of anywhere up near the head.  This along with the way they're shaped to be concaved makes it highly unlikely they'll be pressed by accident. But even if you do press them by accident, the device automatically locks them about 30s after the temperature is set. If you want to change the temp or turn it off after that, you need to click the power button twice to unlock them.<br /><br />The teeth are not only steep enough to accommodate my thick hair, but there's also way more of them packed more densely together. This seems to make this brush MUCH quicker at straightening my hair, and it can also get it board straight. The other brushes have only gotten it as close as a little wave.<br /><br />Since my hair is so thick, I also have to place my hand on the bristles while I pull the brush through so it gets all my hair in it. This is the only model I've tried which hasn't burned me even once while using it so far. The teeth are so densely packed that there is no way for a finger or the side of my hand to slip down past the safety portion of it.<br /><br />Quick heating? Honestly I don't know why anyone tries to claim that.... I've never seen any heated hair product heat up quickly. My stove doesn't even heat up quickly. I hardly expect my straightening iron or brush to defy the laws of physics so I don't have to wait a few minutes for it to heat up. That's why I turn it on BEFORE I'm ready to use it. \ud83d\ude09<br /><br />All joking aside though, this really is a fantastic brush. It even FEELS high quality.

It will help the wax grip to the hair better so you will get better results.  When pulling the paper off of skin, always pull up and not out against the way the hair is growing.

I really wanted a kit that included multiple heads, particularly a more narrow one that I could use on the sides of and crevices next to my nose as my skin is very dry there and this tool helps immensely with product absorption.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. The heads are very easily interchangeable, but twist them gently on and off as I understand the heads could easily get stuck on the handle and then you\u2019re left only being able to use the one.<br />2. The silicon cleansing head is exactly what I wanted. Gentle enough for every day use, but still does a great job at getting a deeper clean and prepping skin for dermal rolling.<br />3. The added sanitation tray and instructions for cleaning are very helpful. I appreciate that this company wants to ensure customers know how to use the product safely.<br />4. The device came vacuum sealed in plastic ensuring no contamination occurred after packaging.<br />5. The needles are sturdy and an appropriate length for at home use. Anything longer or wider increases risk for infection and should not be used by non-professionals.<br />6. The metal ice roller attachment worked well at relieving tension and pressure. As someone who experiences migraines, this was a huge plus. It also helped reduce puffiness and inflammation, especially after using the needle heads, and added an extra soothing element used over sheetmasks and seemed to improve absorption of the essence in the mask.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. My only real concern is the small, circular head that is for \u201ctopical skin.\u201d The needles on this attachment are longer and can easily puncture the skin more than intended. Even using very gently, I felt this attachment puncture into the deeper levels of my dermis and that did cause some concern for me. I took one star off for this reason. I have decided to only use this attachment on blemishes to increase absorption of acne treatment products and only after 5-7 minutes of soaking in 90% isopropyl alcohol. I would absolutely never use this on more delicate or thinner skinned areas like the under eye, brow bone, forehead, or nasolabial folds.<br /><br />All in all, I am very happy with this product and would highly recommend it.", "images": [], "asin": "B07L2T4LBY", "parent_asin": "B07L2T4LBY", "user_id": "AFVHDKUIJFAKQ6PN3CX6MBWMFQ5A", "timestamp": 1554573309200, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}], "target": {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Like!", "text": "Like everyone else, I was so not a fan of the face wash.

Not going to lie. However, there are times when even someone with permanent makeup needs a touch up, and eyebrows seem to require a touch up more than anything else. I love this tattoo pen for touch ups. The strokes applied really do look exactly like eyebrow hairs, and I found them easy to apply. The pen is like a felt-tip pen, so if you can use one of those, you can use this. Sometimes it seems as though the color doesn't want to come out. If that happens, just hold the pen with the applicator side down, and it will work fine. For me, at least, the product has been smudge-proof and lasts till I wash it off. (It is waterproof; you have to apply cleanser to remove it.) The color looks quite natural as well and blends with my real eyebrows and permanent makeup perfectly. This isn't just for people with permanent makeup, however. This is a wonderful tattoo pen for those with natural eyebrows who just want to fill them in a bit, make them fuller and more lush. (Haven't we all over-plucked or over-waxed?) Heavy eyebrows seem to be \"in\" right now, and if that's what you want, this tattoo pen will give them to you. The only minus I can find right now is that my color is not in stock.

I love having a glue and bond in a single tube, because I always apply glue using the mini mascara wand and then apply another brush-applicator glue to the band before I apply and fuse. This glue is less sticky than my favorite Calailis glue, so it\u2019s definitely easier to work with. I don\u2019t know yet how it\u2019s going to hold up. The lashes themselves are beautiful, very similar to the Easitension lashes which are great beginner lashes since they are so easy to apply.  I love the wand on the Glass coating, which is a straight dupe of Lashify Glass.  The little fluffy knob on the end of the wand makes it easier to get into small areas like the tops of the lashes. I barely feel like this glue/bond combo needs a sealer though since there\u2019s just not a lot of stickiness to deal with. Really the only other thing that you need to complete this kit is a good applicator tool, because I don\u2019t care for using the regular set of tweezers included.  Not only is the angle not great for application, but there\u2019s no way to fuse unless you use your fingers which I don\u2019t care to do. I will update this review when I find out more about the longevity of the lashes. I always wait 24 hours before getting my lashes wet and that seems to allow them to cure properly.", "images": [], "asin": "B098SC44N6", "parent_asin": "B098SC44N6", "user_id": "AFBOCEST4IRAQO3SZVXLCGSL2EBQ", "timestamp": 1628623451646, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": true}}

This Premium Nature Argan Oil Shampoo, Conditioner, and Thermal Shield Set works well for my hair type. The Argan Oil provides the extra conditioning I need without weighing my hair down. Although the bottles are smaller than the ones they sell separately, I like that these come in a set, since they all work great together. I see that most reviewers love the scent of these. That is the only thing I don't particularly like. Although the scent is unisex, it smells a little too masculine for my preference, but that is just my own preference. I love the handy flip lids on the shampoo and conditioner and the sprayer is great for the thermal shield. A huge plus to me is when a product comes with tamper-proofing, which this set comes completely wrapped in plastic, so I know it has not been tampered with.<br /><br />The shampoo is rich and opaque and, just from the creaminess, I knew this would work well on my hair. The clear shampoos are usually not conditioning enough (in general), but the creamy ones, like this, are great. The conditioner is the same, very thick and rich, perfect for my wavy, dry, color-treated hair. It may weigh finer hair down a bit much, unless used more sparsely. The thermal shield helps keep my waves from becoming frizzy. It is lightly conditioning and softening. It sprays evenly and just the right amount. I like these being sold in the set for trial purposes and then the ability to purchase them separate as well, once you run out or the smaller set sizes.<br /><br />This is a nice set of wonderfully moisturizing, softening, and frizz-taming products that add shine, bounce, and softness.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+qLqAbKXL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+qLqAbKXL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+qLqAbKXL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71335crca5L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71335crca5L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71335crca5L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714ShQW24cL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714ShQW24cL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714ShQW24cL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Fl+3+xaRL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Fl+3+xaRL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Fl+3+xaRL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VIZYZS6PL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VIZYZS6PL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VIZYZS6PL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01GS8J18E", "parent_asin": "B01GS8J18E", "user_id": "AHQ4VAOPWBYUD3FUNK53CM6N77BA", "timestamp": 1492615519000, "helpful_vote": 13, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "~ Use this for Soft, Shiny, Deliciously Scented Hair! ~", "text": "Unite is my very favorite EVER Argan Hair Oil.

This dryer leaves my hair with no static electricity and softer, healthier-looking hair. There are so many choices with the five modes and different levels. I love to finish up with the cool shot, which helps hold whatever style I go with. This blow dryer really is perfect for any type of hair with all its possibilities. The magnetic and easy-to-use-and-position nozzles and diffuser are great. They stay in place well but attach and remove easily. The extra long cord is helpful. This folds up easily for storage or travel. It's super-lightweight and comfortable and easy to use.

Great wig", "text": "Amazing! one word of advice though.. synthetic wigs are fibers do not have  mbrush ones like this with a &#34;far back&#34; or &#34;deep&#34; lace front (and that part is all hand tied btw) ,and then the rest of the wig is machine made,... or you will be inone big mess lol find the widest tooth comb u can and use that starting from the ends at the very bottom going towards top of head section by section slowwwwwly or &#34;Luxor's wet brush&#34; brushing same way Amazon definitely sells it think for about $8 or $10 but  not only is this brush  amazing for your hair but it's awesomeeeee for synthetic wigs as well as humans course. as you can see I am a licensed cosmetologist for over 12 years and I have never seen a brush transforn all of my clients hair into such healthier hair once you get this bro she will never go back ik back to the wig I never write reviews btw but thought I'd offer some advice bc I own over50 wigs!! Lol it's z healthy way to change ur hair color! Anyway Google what are the different material they use to make synthetic wigs and see which look is best for you!  As far as care goes get the comb or that brush along with baby oil, baby powder (or dry shampoo) ..a sulfate free shampoo n conditioner and this is so good for ur hair as well (Loreal has good ones that you can get anywhere) larger sized zip lock bags (not brand) (everything iin this review can be &#34;equate brand&#34; or any generic) clips, and finally an old empty spray bottle if U have one that use to be a product wash it good and refil it with bittled water or filtered  or just buy one in the &#34;travel size items isle&#34; and full that up...Ok so if the ends of your long shiny beautiful wig like this one gets frayed looking or frizzy you are aloud to use heat on this particular wig ( it usually always says it in the info somewhere) so what u wanna do is either wash n condition it first only if It's been a very long time..,.. do not wash synthetic wigs often! I repeat (ok u get it) ok so when u wash a wig ur suppose to fill sink up w a squeeze of shampoo n wTer let sit for 15 rinse. Cool water blot w towel then repeat  steps with the conditioner  and rinse w cool cold water. Ok then blow dry on warm or let sit over night n air dry then once wig is dry get you clips and spray bottle (or if u didn't have to was it you would start here) Clip the top sections up leaving all the hair right above ur ears and below down spray about 3-4 times w water set flat iron to 150-200 no higher! N take a your wet brush or comb n comb the damp hair n flat iron it while damp ull see steam that's ok ;) repeat steps until hair feels how it did when first purchased :) one your done get your baby oil n run a little like the size of a dime rub it on your hands as if it was lotion then take your hands and rub it through wig comb or brush it nicely n gently from ends to top n every evening before bed store it in a plastic bag try n get all air out of bag while sealing it! If u at least do the oil n bag every night for storage this will keep ur synthetic wig nice n it will last you way longer then if not. The bottoms of synthetic wigs tend to get ratty and poofy fizzy like looking so always be extra generous with moisture as wigs are not hair growing from your head getting all those natural oils.. And the flat iron n water trick is the best for that like I said..but anyway as your doing this an old lamp (not plugged in)!lmao or a huge candle will work as a manequin head or simply type in &#34;styrofoam manequin head for wig &#34;on here or go to ur local beauty supply and they should have one if you ask! They're like 3-$4 the baby powder or dry shampoo is for top to middie only(not in the bottom or ends) if wig is toooooi shiny looking! Ok I'm done holy crap no wonder y I don't write reviews lol ...but yes this wig is gorgeous Lolll hope I helped someone out there", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61fMZicI8GL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61fMZicI8GL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61fMZicI8GL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B011FR6Z8W", "parent_asin": "B011FR6Z8W", "user_id": "AG2UTPMNQPNAIA25N3IGOGU55XVQ", "timestamp": 1452378908000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Five Stars", "text": "Excellent", "images": [], "asin": "B01D20QD9Q", "parent_asin": "B01D20QD9Q", "user_id": "AG2UTPMNQPNAIA25N3IGOGU55XVQ", "timestamp": 1480242743000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Bad", "text": "Horrible", "images": [], "asin": "B017BI89GK", "parent_asin": "B017BI89GK", "user_id": "AG2UTPMNQPNAIA25N3IGOGU55XVQ", "timestamp": 1488256897000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}], "target": {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing!!!", "text": "You guys these lashes are amazing if you like dramatic lashes!

I was very hesitant on ordering and it\u2019s been in my wish list for awhile but there were no reviews... I got an amazon gift card recently so I figured now would be the time to try it. The hair is soft enough, not incredibly soft but not terrible. It\u2019s a bit on the shiny side but some baby powder can take care of that. The part is excellent. Looks real without a cap on underneath and goes deep. My head is 22 inches and this fit great. A comb at the nape of the neck is a must imo and this has one. I love the pretty colors. The pink is more peachy orange pink than pink pink but that\u2019s ok. It goes from a super dark brown root to the peach pink to lavender to white/platinum blonde. One major dislike, and a reason I took away a star, is that it\u2019s only rooted on top and along the front side of the unit. The rest of the hair underneath starts with the peach pink. Common at this price point but I\u2019d rather pay a few dollars more and have it rooted the whole way through. But this is the only wig with this color that I can find so it is what it is. The lace is light enough to be nearly invisible on me. Not scratchy, the unit was comfy to wear. The hairline could stand to be plucked more naturally if I ever find the time.

The images provided on the listing looked like the color I\u2019ve been looking for. I posted a question asking the seller to provide images of the actual unit and the stock pictures I uploaded are the ones that were sent to me. Before I go any further I\u2019d like to say the seller provided fast and courteous customer service, which is why my rating is 2 stars instead of 1. I\u2019m terribly disappointed in the wig itself. The first unit I received, upon first taking it out, seemed nice and I was excited. There was a comb at the nape of the neck, the part looked nice and the hair itself felt soft and moved nicely. Then I tried it on and noticed a large bump on top of my head, which is what the picture with the red circle is. Turns out at the beginning of the track the hair is all short, frizzy and matted, like it was burned, which is what was causing that bump. I notified the seller and requested a replacement. The seller was responsive to my feedback and seemed genuinely interested in it and concerned about the quality. I received the replacement yesterday and it was even worse... :( The hair throughout the unit was very very dry and ratty. And the same issue was at the top, short, frizzy, matted hair, but more so. Soooo bummed about this. Seems to be some serious quality control issues wherever these units are being produced. This wig would have been so great if it wasn\u2019t for what appears to be an overheating issue when making the waves. I hope the seller can get this fixed, because the colors are beautiful.

It was packaged nicely especially since it was sent in a box! When I first took the wig out I saw that I received some eye lashes but no wig cap. The hair on the wig is very soft and manageable but when I tried it on, the first thing I was disappointed in was that the cap was smaller than I expected. The color is beautiful but lighter than expected. But I was so disappointed in the construction of the wig. If you look at the picture of me you can already see the weft showing through the bangs.

If you have a very sensitive head, I recommend you wear a wig cap because they can pull a haor are two. I do wear wig caps and the grip hold on the wig and the wig does sit still. Unless the wig is bigger than your head and then the wig might move around. But sometimes I don't wear a wig cap and it is comfortable for me.
