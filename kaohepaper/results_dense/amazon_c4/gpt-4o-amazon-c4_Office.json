The design is super clever, allowing me to store them vertically, which saves so much space. I love the sliding feature\u2014it's smooth and adds a touch of elegance to the rack. The assembly process was quite straightforward, thanks to the little white stickers labeled A-D. These labels made the whole setup a breeze, and I took my time to avoid any backtracking. I used a T-handle hex screw wrench and the tool provided, as an electric screwdriver would have been too powerful. The materials are top-notch, with Chinese steel and a really interesting wood finish that adds character to my room. Although I wish it was a bit cheaper, I can't complain about the quality. It took me about 20 minutes to assemble, which was totally reasonable. Overall, I'm really satisfied with this purchase!\"\n)\n</answer>",
