Construct the query using Boolean operators:\n   - Use \"AND\" to ensure all key components are included in the search results.\n   - Use \"OR\" to include synonyms or related terms for broader coverage.\n\n4.

Identify key components:\n   - \"upright\": This suggests a specific type of infant seat that is not rear-facing or convertible.\n   - \"infant\": Indicates the product is for very young children, typically newborns or very young babies.\n   - \"seat\": The main product category.\n3. Consider synonyms and related terms:\n   - \"upright\" could also be referred to as \"vertical\" or \"standing\".\n   - \"infant\" might also be represented by \"baby\", \"newborn\", or \"toddler\" (though toddler is slightly older, it can sometimes be used interchangeably).\n   - \"seat\" could include \"stroller\", \"crib\", or \"bouncer\" if they are similar in function or design.\n4. Construct a Boolean query:\n   - Use AND to ensure all key components are included.\n   - Use OR to include synonyms and related terms.\n5. Final query construction:\n   - (\"upright\" OR \"vertical\" OR \"standing\") AND (\"infant\" OR \"baby\" OR \"newborn\" OR \"toddler\") AND (\"seat\" OR \"stroller\" OR \"crib\" OR \"bouncer\").\nThis query will help retrieve products that match the description of an upright infant seat, considering variations in terminology.",
