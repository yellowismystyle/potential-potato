Because of the supportive cushion, it raises me up a few inches which I appreciate since I'm quite short.  The photo of the cushion on my chair is what it looks like after being used for a month.

Each box comes with four pens, so if you were to give a full set of four as a gift, it'd be easy to wrap this rectangular-shaped box or, since the box is so nice, you wouldn't even need to wrap it.  Just tuck it into a stocking or gift bag.  So, now on to a review of the pens themselves.  These pens write nicely!  They are fine point, gel ink, so I really like writing with them.  I'm partial to fine point, too.  The pens write smoothly and allow for a nice grip.  They are retractable, and each pen has a different design and all are appropriately festive.  I'm thinking of maybe breaking up the set and giving a pen to four different people or maybe two pens per person.

This printer is used as a home printer / copier so the internal set of cartridges lasted almost a year before I ordered and replaced the Canon originals with an aftermarket brand of toner which gave me approximately 60% service life before banding began to show up on my documents. The initial replacement toner was not the \"\"True Image\"\" brand which this review addresses.<br /><br />Last month I ordered the True Image laser cartridges and installed them in the first week of January this year and as of this posting the cartridges meet or exceed both the original Canon toner cartridges and the first aftermarket brand. I purchased the True Image because the cost is very reasonable especially if one compares OEM printer cartridges which can cost as much as a new printer.<br /><br />So far the True Image is working superbly, they do offer tech support, replacement and refund with the term \"\"lifetime\"\" and if I get 70% usage I will be pleased and will certainly buy them again especially if my current experience continues. When one considers that the True Image is about 1/5 the cost of OEM's, give them a try because even at 50% life you are still ahead versus the cost of OEM.\""

        "ori_review": "\"Solid basic office chair, good for someone of average height or shorter I got this chair to replace my current office chair which, after over a decade, has seen better days. When I took everything out of the box, at first I was a little overwhelmed and thought it might be a little difficult to assemble with all the parts. Turned out it wasn't at all. The instructions were very simple, clear and easy to understand with a good numbering system for reference.  In fact, the instructions were so easy to understand that I missed a couple steps (thinking I had it all figured out) and caused myself grief (like forgetting the washers in Step 4 so I had to take out the screws and do it again).<br /><br />UPDATE:  Since this chair didn't work for me, I gave it to my daughter to use when she's working at her craft table and she loves it!  She said the size works fine for her (she's just a little shorter than me), it's sturdy and comfortable and she loves how the arms go up and down.  So I've changed my review to five stars.<br /><br />I think it took about an hour to assemble, but that was with multiple interruptions (and, of course, causing myself grief by not following the steps). Just a heads-up, on Step 3 where it says to tighten the screws attaching the armrests to the chair back and cover them with decorative caps, don't follow that part. Follow the instruction right below it in the same box that tells you to NOT tighten the screws until the chair is fully assembled. You need them a little bit loose for when you assemble the seat bottom in Step 4. Then you can fully tighten all screws and place the decorative caps.<br /><br />As for appearance, the chair looks really sharp, really classy and would look great in a professional office setting or at home. As for function, it swivels easily, slides across the floor well, feels very stable, and all adjustment mechanisms were smooth and easy to operate. It also has arms which can be raised and lowered and it comes with spare parts, which is always a good thing just in case.<br /><br />So why did I give it a 4 instead of a 5? Two reasons. As I said, I bought this chair to replace my comfy old chair that's no so cushiony anymore, but for me and the chronic pain I suffer from, this chair just didn't work. I sat in it and worked for about an hour and a half and was in a whole lot of pain when I got up, which was difficult because I also got very stiff sitting in it. The chair back does have a really good design that's very supportive of the lower back and that's a great feature and the seat cushion is made of very solid material which has some give as you're seated, but it's pretty stiff. And while it may and likely would \"\"soften up\"\" with time, it is just too hard for me to take sitting on for long stretches like my job requires let alone to do it for a potentially long break-in period.<br /><br />And the other issue is it was a little too small for me. I'm 5'9\"\" and both the back and seat cushion were just too short. The seat cushion was several inches short of the backs of my knees and the chair back came up to midshoulder on me, so it wasn't super comfortable or supportive for the upper back and legs as a taller person. It might be great for someone maybe 5'6\"\" and under, though.<br /><br />Overall, it's a solid, good-looking, well-made office chair that did exceed my expectations but sadly fell short in a couple important areas.\""

No need to unroll and hope that it will flatten. This material is thick, with a slight give, but definitely NOT bendable.<br /><br />Works great on our medium (now somewhat low due to age) carpet.  Zero to little effort is needed to move my chair now in front of my desk with this mat underneath.

I got a Flashforge Adventure 3 printer for Christmas and, when ordering more filament, verified that it could hold a 1kg spool, (the indention in the side of the machine for the spool to rest half inside looked small to me). Machine specs said that it would, so I ordered more filament. Only to find out that it only holds 'their' brand 1 kg filament, and they pretty much only have primary colors. I printed an extender piece and cut the inside edge off filament rolls made of cardboard, but most rolls seem to come on plastic. Which won't fit. And printing a longer extender led to errors, every single time. My husband saw this and told me to grab it. If it fit my bigger spools, then great, if not, we could use it for our thermal printer.<br /><br />Surprise, surprise, take the unnecessary back piece off and it fits a 1 kg spool perfectly!<br /><br />I can set this on the table right next to my printer and it'll roll out the filament through perfectly as the machine sucks it in. The price is amazing considering all the hassle that I'm avoiding. This right here has saved me time, money, and a lot of aggravation. I can order whatever color and type of filament that I want now, because this guy has saved the day!! It was quick and easy setup, it's lightweight, but sturdy, and it's a great price.

I've tried other pens with smaller tip sizes for specific purposes, but they aren't as enjoyable to write with. I also need a pen that won't bleed through the thin paper in my pocket calendar and won't smudge since I'm left-handed. It's important to me that the pen I choose has vibrant and joyful colors, as I like to visualize in color. I've had experiences with gel pens that frequently drag and even leak or explode on airplanes, but I haven't had these issues with the Zebra Sarasa Dry pen. I've ordered this pen multiple times and it's always a delight to receive a new set. As a tip for other writers, if the pen starts to drag, simply shake it vigorously for a few seconds and the ink will flow smoothly again. I absolutely adore these pens!",

Gel pens in general are good things (unless they drag), but the Zebra Sarasa Dry pen in the 0.7 mm med tip size has become my go-to for literally several years now.  The size is perfect for everyday writing -- not too big, not too small (and I do have other .5 and .3 mm pens for tiny script on blueprints, but they aren't nearly as pleasant to write with whatsoever).  My pocket calendar has the world's thinnest paper, and the Zebra Sarasa doesn't bleed through.  I'm a lefty & it doesn't smudge.  The 14-pen set's colors are vibrant and joyful, which is a must for creative peeps who visualize in color. I have reordered these multiple times & it's always a treat to open a new set. WRITER'S TIP: ALL gel pens can get draggy from time to time (although these drag almost never). If that happens, just shake the pen hard for a few seconds and the ink redescends. I've had other gel pens that drag constantly (these truly don't) AND leak/explode in the air on planes. These don't. I LOVE them."

The film itself is not very sticky as opposed to other Decal paper\u2019s I\u2019ve used in the past.<br /><br />I highly recommend using a solution such as \u201cMicro Sol\u201d and \u201cMicro Set\u201d to soften the decals and make them more easier to work with. I won\u2019t explain how to use Micro Sol and Micro Set in this review as their are plenty of YouTube videos to search for giving you step by step instructions on how to use those solutions.<br /><br />The Matte finish threw me off a bit as I am used to working with highly Glossy Decal paper but it\u2019s understandable considering the paper is compatible with Inkjet printers so their needed to be some chances to the paper itself.<br /><br />I would recommend Koala to keep upgrading the product and maybe using a material that will be a bit more Glossy and that will stick better to the surface one is applying the decal to.<br /><br />I would love to see Koala make a Transparent or \u201cClear\u201d version in the near future.<br /><br />I\u2019ve read some of the reviews and will say to come up with your own judgement once you purchase the decal paper.

The original box was inside another box, but all the parts were brand new and in perfect condition. It took all of 20 minutes to put together - instructions were super clear and easy to follow. I have had the chair for over a week and use it for 8+ hrs a day and it is very comfortable for me. One thing I will point out if you need a chair that goes pretty high, this may not be the one for you. I am short, so works for me. I LOVE I can flip the arms up."

I intend to swap the card out every few days or when I feel I need to.  This set of affirmation cards is unique because each card includes suggestions for essential oils and crystals for each affirmation.  The cards are really so beautiful, I can't say enough about them.  Gilded, rounded edges.  Heavy cardstock.  The front of each card is holographic.  The back has affirmations relating to the main affirmation on the front of the card.  These really are special.  I feel that a lot of thought went into these cards.  Definitely the nicest affirmations cards I've come across.<br /><br />I do love the idea of the beautiful box it came in, but my box arrived a little smashed and since I wouldn't be storing the crystal and stand in the box, I wish the deck of cards had their own nice box for storage.<br /><br />I do have a lot of selenite at home.  I've been collecting rocks and crystals since I was a child, just because I always felt they were beautiful and special.  I probably have at least 15 selenite pieces, but I'm not a fan of the raw wand included in this set.  To me, it's uncomfortable to hold.  I would rather have it smooth, but maybe that's a matter of personal preference or maybe my wand isn't the same as the one you'll get.  I included a picture of the shards in the box that made me feel uncomfortable handling the selenite.<br /><br />In summary, the cards are beyond compare.  The box is lovely for gifting, and for storage of the whole set. Although the box is beautiful, it's not as practical when the items are in use.  I don't need such a big box to store just the cards.  The stand is simple, pretty, works as intended.  The selenite is not my favorite.  Overall, I would give it a 4.75, so I feel like I need to round up to a 5.  I hope this review helps you decide if this set is for you!<br /><br />In the attached pictures, you'll see one card (front and back) with a rose quartz from my collection (since rose quartz was recommended for the \"\"love\"\" affirmation).  The box, which is lovely, but slightly damaged before it got to me.  Lastly, the inside of the box with the tiny selenite shards that have come off the selenite wand.\""

It's an investment that exhibits a thoughtful blend of luxurious design and material transparency.<br /><br />Coming from the reputable metal craftsmen at Unique Metals, this 1 ounce Troy titanium bar reflects the company's commitment to both ultra-durability and superior quality. For those uninitiated in the world of metals, titanium is renowned for its impressive strength-to-weight ratio, making it both lightweight and sturdy.<br /><br />Looking at the aesthetics of the bar, the decision to keep things simple yet sophisticated is commendable. The clean, straightforward design and fine engraving details give it a refined appeal that fits smoothly into any collection. A point to note, however, is the lack of ornamentation, which some collectors might find lacking if they prefer a more decorated or extravagant design.<br /><br />One major selling point is the included Certificate of Authenticity. This document guarantees that you're purchasing genuine titanium. The bar itself is encapsulated in a protective covering, ensuring damage prevention. These features, coupled with the trustworthy reputation of Unique Metals, provide a feeling of security for your purchase.<br /><br />Although the bar seems perfect at first, the decision to stick with only one size (1 Troy Ounce) may be seen as a limitation for some buyers. Those desiring a heftier weight or a minor one to fit their particular collection might find this off-putting.<br /><br />Despite these minor drawbacks, the Unique Metals Titanium Bar w/COA strikes an admirable balance between quality and aesthetic appeal. Its superior durability, combined with its guarantee of authenticity, makes it a hard-to-resist acquisition for any collector or investor.<br /><br />Note: This review is based on hypothetical positive feedback. It's always important to conduct thorough research and consider professional advice before making any investment decisions."

I am a huge labeler and have several different types of label makers/printers at home. This is the smallest one I have and it's super portable AND adorable. I'm actually keeping this one in my car for car organization and for on-the-go \"\"emergency\"\" use.<br /><br />It comes in a cute pink box with the label maker, manual, USB cord, and 5 label rolls (1 plain white, 4 with designs/patterns). The shape and color of this label printer reminds me of a macaron, and I am obsessed with macaron-designed products, so I immediately loved this mini cylindrical label maker. Thank goodness it works well too.<br /><br />It's very easy to use. You just charge it with the USB cord (mine arrived already charged), insert a label roll, press the power button for 3-4 seconds, then connect app to printer via bluetooth.<br /><br />You can install the phone app using the QR code in the manual, or just look for the HerePrint app from the Google Play Store. Once you have the app opened, it's pretty easy to navigate. Make sure your'e connected to the printer (mine was HPRT H11-4723), click on Scan, then scan the QR code on the label roll to create your label.<br /><br />There's so many features to customize your label: color, font size, font, line/character spacing, add images/bubbles/stickers/date/barcode/etc. You can go to \"\"History\"\" and reprint a previous label you made. If you go to \"\"Me\"\", you can access an electronic version of the user manual, FAQ, technical support/live chat, and it has an option that takes you directly to their Amazon page to buy printer supplies (i.e. label rolls) as well. The \"\"Me\"\" section is very convenient to have available in the app and I appreciate it.<br /><br />Huge plus that this is rechargeable, can be used cordless, and never will require ink b/c it uses thermal technology. FYI, I have an Android/Samsung phone.\""

Using a flathead screw driver, I was able to easily leverage the old wheels/casters out with minimal effort.  I feel like I have a new chair again.  My chair now moves super smooth and is easily 100% quieter for my neighbors downstairs. 10/10 would highly recommend upgrading your office chair to these or for replacement, even if your old crappy wheels still work.  Honestly for like $22 I regret doing it sooner, folks."
