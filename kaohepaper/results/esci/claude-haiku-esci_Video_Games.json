To find the most relevant products, I will use the following query structure:\n   - Include the keywords \"ultraman\" and \"snes\" using the AND operator to ensure the results contain both terms.\n   - Consider including related terms such as \"super nintendo\" or \"super famicom\" (the Japanese name for the SNES) using the OR operator to broaden the search.\n   - Optionally, I can include additional terms like \"game\", \"video game\", or \"merchandise\" to further refine the search and focus on products rather than general information about Ultraman or the SNES.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n{\n    \"query\": \"(ultraman AND snes) OR (ultraman AND (super nintendo OR super famicom)) OR (ultraman AND (game OR video game OR merchandise))\"\n}\n</answer>",

Since \"vida\" is a brand name, it should be included as a specific term in the query to retrieve products from that brand.\n\n3. \"Charging station\" is a more general term that could refer to various types of charging devices. To narrow down the results, I will include more specific terms related to the type of charging station, such as \"electric\", \"car\", \"vehicle\", etc.\n\n4. To ensure the results are most relevant to the customer's needs, I will also include terms related to the intended use case, such as \"home\", \"office\", \"travel\", etc.\n\n5.
