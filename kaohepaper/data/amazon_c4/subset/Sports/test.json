So, here's the deal if anyone is interested in purchasing and replacing their old EZ-1 bike seat...<br />This new seat is slightly smaller than the old seat that J&B used to make (for the old \"\"ladder-shaped\"\" frame). It's possible they make the same size seat as the old EZ-1 bike seat, but I didn't do much research and just bought the seat anyway.<br />It fits the sliding bracket on the bottom of the old bike, which was good, and the threaded fittings in the bottom of the seat line up fine. The seat like I mentioned is slightly smaller and so it doesn't fill-in the gap between the back of the seat and the seatback. So, you can drill and extend out the four holes in the steel seat bracket and move the new seat back, closer to the mesh seatback. It's not necessary, but it's better than having that gap...it would give better lower back support.<br />J&B did replace the wood on the bottom of the seat on this new seat and replaced it with a plastic material, and that was a better idea. The seats had problems with those tubed threads disappearing into the foam of the seat, and the wood would also rot and cause problems with the bolts attaching to the bottom of the wood base plate. So that solved another problem.<br />I'm not particularly fond of the new EZ-1 design they came up with, but in the meantime, this new seat will work, and I'll check with J&B and the Sunseeker guys to see if they offer the same dimensions on this new seat as they did on their old frame design.<br />Even though this new seat was not made for the EZ-1 old bike design (as Amazon stated it was a replacement for another bike or trike), overall, a quality seat cover and should be fine until I wear this one out!\""

It would be great if the swivel comes with a small tray that securely holds a smartphone and provides extra storage.

        "ori_review": "\"Makes doing off bike exercises easier I got my Peloton a few years ago so the Monitor was on a fixed arm with a single point of articulation (tilt up/down).  Which is great when you're on your bike but if you want to do some arms afterwards you either have to go to a mobile device, be seated for the workout, or stand behind the bike.  And, trying to use the built in monitor for yoga or another workout type is just not really practical if you need to see the instructor all the time.<br /><br />This swivel will move you from having that single point of articulation to having three points.<br />- Where the swivel attaches to the arm<br />- Where the swivel attaches to the monitor<br />- A mid-swivel point of rotation<br /><br />What that translates to is that your monitor will be about 5-6\"\" higher than before.  When tipped up for looking at while riding the monitor will now be just a little above the handles.  If you rotate the monitor 180 degrees you can actually tip it down for mat workouts.  And, you can easily workout alongside the bike.<br /><br />There's also a little hook on the back of the swivel so you can hang things on there.  The first thing that comes to mind is headphones, charging cable for the headphones, or a sweat towel.  But, I haven't really found a killer use for the hook yet.<br /><br />Installation was not bad at all but the small pressed steel wrench that ships with the kit was terrible.  My installers had really cranked down hard on the nut when installing my monitor and that dinky little wrench would not hold a bite on the nut enough to even turn it.  It slipped multiple times and I was afraid I'd strip the surface of the nut.  So I pulled out a 13mm box set wrench and then installation was super slick.  I was able to prop the monitor on the handlebars while doing the installation.  But, if you have any concerns at all you will want a second set of hands to do this installation.  It's just not worth dropping and breaking your monitor.<br /><br />The small tray that comes with it has two sets of bands that can hold it in place.  Black and red, so you can choose your esthetic.  It seems pretty secure and holds a smart phone with plenty of room.  I don't often look at my phone while on the bike, but it is handy to toss my phone on there for quick access if I'm on support for work or waiting for a call/message.  When I'm not on the bike I keep my wireless headphones resting there so the cord doesn't get all tangled up.  I might not have gone out of my way to get the tray separately but as an extra that came with this swivel its a nice plus that adds value to the whole package.<br /><br />If you want to be able to work out next to your bike, or even directly behind the monitor while using your bike monitor this swivel will not disappoint.  Just be sure to tighten it down enough that things won't slip during use.\""

Being on the tall and heavy side of things, I always feel a bit awkward on regular yoga mats, my downtown sometimes slips off the edges. This mat is great, it's longer and wider than a regular mat making it perfectly sized for me. It's also pretty grippy for how cheap it is. It also just commands attention by its sheer volume, makes a statement and makes me feel much more confident in those awkward sweaty positions lol."

Just make sure you have adequately long nails to open up all the tools. Otherwise, you might hate it and wish you had bought something else."

I would also use them periodically during the day as I did things outside. When I would turn in for the night these things were still blazing hot. These are about the size of a cigarette pack but not quite as thick and are wonderful!

I don't like throwing them in the dirt. when wading the armpits work ackwardly, and are not ideal. My first thought was how well its made and plenty stiff enough to not sag, and dump my rods in the water. Next I checked out the belt loop. now they are heavy velcro clad strap, but look very small. I was kind of uneasy thinking it would be too small to fit. Glad I was wrong. Strapped it on my belt, placed my 9' 5-7 wt fly rod into the holder, attached the velcro and let go. My rod was held securely, without sagging. Booms is proving to me to make quality product from good material with the fisherman in mindat a reasonable price. Love it. Will be buying more."

With water distributed among multiple containers we were protected against one container failing and losing our water in the desert while still economically storing a large amount with the ability to refill.  These are not hard-sided, and so I was concerned about possible gear puncturing the bags, so we placed them in a cargo box for protection.  Easy solution to protect the bags.  Not that I was concerned about a minor event puncturing them because they are thick plastic, but you can't be too careful when water resupply in hot weather might be a concern.  A cargo box made a great way to hold them rather than having them loose in the back of the van, and the cargo box is not a dedicated water container and can be used for anything when not used to store the water bags.  I would gladly use these for any extended camping trip, and at home use them for a water supply in the event of a disaster.  It's a great product.  I had considered a large water bladder, but this is less expensive and seems less risky in the event of an incident puncturing a bag due to multiple bags mitigating the risk."

Used the jacket for 4 days straight in that wet Alaska weather and stayed dry the whole time.<br /><br />IRON METHOD;  Today I did a refresh for winter, Sprayed it on in small sections, rubbed it in with the glove, and used a Iron on medium heat to bake it in = it's ready to wear and the patina finish looks amazing. For me the iron method worked much better than the heat gun, faster and much less after odor. Basically ready to wear no waiting. Your results may vary.  I bought a cheap iron for 10 bucks to use on the jacket because some of the wax will build up in the steamer holes of the iron which could upset the other half.<br /><br />The other item I used it on a was pair of \"\"waterproof\"\" hiking shoes that started leaking through the membrane  after the 2nd use and the return date had passed. Gave them two coats of this product = issue solved. Feet stay nice and dry, used a heat gun to bake it in coat.\""

I put it under his small active table for when he likes to play with play doh and slime. Getting play doh and slime out of carpet can be a big pain. Quickly passing the vacuum over this mat is a lifesaver. Occasionally my 4 year old likes to paint, so I saw how perfect this mat could be to put under her and my toddler as well. I used to have to find a big piece of Butcher paper to put on the dining table so they wouldn't get any paint on it. Now, I'm just having them lay on the floor with their pieces of paper over this mat while they paint. Of course, using gentle watercolor paint (kid paint) to be careful not to stain the mat. So far it's cleaned up well.<br />Lastly, I'd just like to say this mat is perfect for picnics. It's in my plans to take it with me for picnics once it finally starts feeling like fall where I live. I like to take my kids to the park, so sitting down with them on the grass over this little mat will be lots of fun.<br /><br />I highly recommend this high quality versatile mat that has many uses and can save lots of clean-up trouble for parents.\""

So I wanted something I could move around easy, put up and put down easy and have small footprint in the garage when I put it away for winter.  I was very worried I wouldn\u2019t find anything sturdy enough.  I was very wrong, this is EXACTLY what I wanted, but didn\u2019t dare hope for.  The one piece legs and sides make this is a sturdy table.  Granted, I am not claiming anyone is going to be standing on this table without it probably breaking, but if you are setting something on it or having a dinner for 4 around it like it was really intended, you are going to be fine.  I really like the metal sides, you could have all 4 people rest their arms on it and not drag it down.  The middle is understandably not as sturdy as there is no support there but the tension between the 4 corners, but it would still hold glass plates and drink ware without issue\u2026there may be slight bounce to it, so don\u2019t over fill those glasses.

I\u2019m wondering if that problem has since been fixed somehow, as it stays on super well, to the point where it\u2019s a tiny bit hard to put on myself, because the part that sticks out and goes in the hole kind of has to click in. It takes effort (but in a good way) to take it off. I love it so far! I don\u2019t regret buying other bands though because the stretchy ones are a bit comfier than the silicone kind. If I hadn\u2019t read the other reviews I honestly would\u2019ve been fine with the one it came with & wouldn\u2019t have given it a second thought."

The way it's designed it does play well with keymod but it is a shining star with it's intended platform, M-LOK. It sits in the M-LOK grooves tightly with no wiggle. There is a small screw to adjust windage and elevation to dial the laser in. It has a built-in rechargeable battery and uses the everpopular USB-C cable to charge. I already had a foregrip and flashlight mounted so I had to do some rearranging to get this where i wanted it, but I still have everything in quick reach of my non-dominant hand. This little laser is solid and feels super durable. Monstrum has a proven track record of quality, at least in my experience with their products. If you want a low profile laser that is bright and crisp without it being one of those annoying lasers that attach to an optic or hang way off the handguard, this is for you.

        "ori_review": "\"Great tent but read this before taking out. It will be an excellent tent for our family,  I wish I would have bought one earlier.  This is a heavy tent, built  for families or or higher end car camping.  The box is heavy even for an average guy.  The carrying bag does not have a padded carrying handle so you will not want to carry this very far.  A real nice feature of the carrying bag is that one end zips all the way around the end side.  see pic 2. allowing access to the contents and makes repacking less of a chore.  The tent itself has plenty of room for everyone.  The \"\"bathtub\"\" style floor of the main compartment is well designed and goes up the sides to help keep out mud and ground water.  The porch canopy is attached so you cannot remove the extra porch area.  This does however offer the best protection from rain as there is no  attachment zippers to allow water in.  The front porch has a floor but while the floor is attached to the porch canopy, the floor is not attached to the main tent.  See pic 4.  I have never had a tent with a porch and this is a very welcome addition.  The kids can keep their shoes outside, yet keep them dry.  Being kids or lazy adults something always gets left outside on the lawn chairs.  If they are under the canopy everything, including the lawn chairs will stay dry.  In the main area there are three windows, one on each side.  Each of these three windows comes with a fiberglass eyebrow style rod and guy strings that adds more room to the tent.  Unfortunately the fiberglass poles were too long.  see pic 8, so we could not install the \"\"eyebrows\"\" .  ( I will cut the poles a little shorter to fit).  The windows could still be staked out without the poles, which would help.  The main room and the canopy are both tall enough for me at 5'10\"\" to easily stand up in without fear of hitting my head (my shoes were on too!).  Because of the hieght it is best with two people setting this up.  My second complaint was the storage bag it came in.  Most tent makers include a carrying bag way to small and this tent is not an exception. pic10  The black bag with all the poles is the heaviest by far.  Please make the green bag bigger or better yet put some straps and a padded carry handle on the black bag.  Then lengthen the two top securing straps on the green bag so both bags can be lashed together for winter storage.  I tried to lash the black pole bag to the top of the green carrying bag but the the securing  straps on the green bag are several inches too short for this pic 10 last pic.  Also the extremely strong poles have a robust elastic cord inside to keep them together in the proper groups.  Four poles for Main, four poles for porch for a total of 8 poles.  Although I mentioned how heavy the poles are, remember this is a good thing for car camping/family camp because the tent will withstand significant winds/storms.  Lots of space, great design and features.  This tent is going to be really fun and I cant wait to get the family out on a great adventure.\""

These are very comfortable on my face and haven't leaked, but there are additional features that make these better-than-average.  They have a nifty little button that you push to adjust the strap, making a tiresome chore much easier.  Having UV protection is a nice bonus.

After 1 year of daily usage (8 miles total) and being in a trunk during some hot days, it works just as good as the day I got it. The battery life is excellent and reliable, as are the motor and breaks. This scooter is lighter* weight.  I use it for the \"\"third leg\"\" of my commute to get from my car to my work, which is a few miles. I especially like that it folds for easy storage. The folding option allows me to store it in my trunk quickly and out of sight for later errands. I am also able to store it out of the way at work and conveniently charge it. It allows me to park farther away for free and save a considerable amount of money on parking while having a commute that takes just as long as trying to navigate a busy parking deck. Not to mention it is quite a blast and I don't show up all sweaty on hot days or worry about walking alone at night. I like that it has two breaking options and different acceleration speeds. It handles hills pretty well but I wouldn't think it would do well on very steep hills  (see incline restrictions). For the larger hills I go on, I will sometimes give it a push to get more momentum. It is smooth and handles well, unlike the scooters you pay for which feel a bit jerky and sudden in their acceleration.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this scooter for someone who wants a faster mode of transportation and an alternative method to a bike or for kids!\""

I used to have a handlebar bag, but I didnt want to get my tools stolen when Im picking up an order and have to leave my bike outside. This bag carries everything I typically carried in my handlebar bag, plus more. it also allows for very easy access. Im able to carry my tire repair kit, a bunch of tools, a portable charger and my wallet. I was surprised when I went outside in the snow/rain and found out it's water resistant. I was also surprised with the quality since the bag is priced so low. I love it, I think I'll buy another one for my everyday carry and leave this one for my bike stuff."

For those who have said that Cabela's cot is better, that is because theirs is 600D, twice as thick if I'm not mistaken, than this 300D version of basically the same cot. Do your homework with pricing on cots, and it wouldn't be misspent money (imho) to purchase a 600D cot for a few extra dollars ($10-15) for the same style of cot. As for putting on the two end pieces, YOU CAN DO IT everyone. It may seem too hard to slip that second piece in/on, but it WILL go. You may notice that the holes on each bar are offset from the ends at different lengths; making the \"\"shorter sided hole\"\" line up with the other bar's \"\"shorter sided hole\"\" may help, but it's still a snug \"\"push/pull/tweak\"\" method that ANYONE can do with just a few seconds and a little patience--it WILL go on. I  have to admit the lightning deal AND the 20% off coupon poked me into this purchase, but I'm glad I have this 300D cot for the interim while I look for a good deal on any 600D cot with good reviews. Of course the 600D will be a bit heavier, but neither are backpacking items, and heavier may equate to longevity.\""

I was blessed a few years ago to start a wrist-stretching routine which has been a game-changer for me, but actual grip strength had been on my to-do list for a while, and that's why I decided to try this set.<br />The set comes with a pair of hand grippers, a finger stretcher, a grip ring and a stress ball, packaged neatly in a small bag for storage. It also comes with a small manual with several exercise suggestions - and that part surprised me at first. Being new to this type of exercise, I didn't know hand grippers were that complicated :)<br />Having used that set for about a week now, I am still on the trial and error part of it, but these are my main takeaways:<br />First, if you decide to take this set, and you are new, like me, to this type of exercise, plan to invest some time on YouTube looking up what the exercises look like. The manual is great for inspiration, but nothing beats a video to explain. Also, there is much more variety of exercises than what the manual shows.<br />As others have noted, take it easy in the beginning (you can guess that I didn't). This set exercises primarily tendons, which seem to react differently than muscles to exercise. The hand grippers are great in that aspect because they are adjustable - I am learning to be patient with the finger stretcher though, which is on the stronger side for me.<br />With respect to comfort, the grippers are OK for my hands, and they seem well-made. I would have loved a lighter finger stretcher to start with, but, I am learning to be patient there. I love the stress ball, and I love learning to do different exercises with it (who knew there were so many options...), and the same goes for the ring. Time will tell how long the set will last, especially the elastic parts, but so far it looks like it is well-made.<br />Overall, a nice set, worth the price. The set is easy to use while watching TV, or even while on a call, so it doesn't really add to my to-do time demands. I might look into a lighter finger stretcher to start with, but for the rest, I am really pleased with it!"

There is nothing to prevent the paddles from rubbing against each other but a divider could easily be added if desired.<br /><br />The paddles are also light weight. They have a honeycomb construction with a graphite playing surface. The handles have comfortable padded grips with double-stitching. The paddles are strong, feel good in the hand and play well.<br /><br />The only thing I noticed is there is no mention of being USAPA Certified, if that is important to you."

Have since ordered another 2 dozen.  They not only do a fantastic job of protecting the guides in transportation and keeping them from getting tangled, a further benefit is the ease with which I can slide my rods in and out of the rod locker in the floor of the boat.  This is particularly noticeable with the bottom holes, which have always been a problem for sliding the guides in and out.  I like the elastic band at the bottom (for hooking around the reel handle), and there are plenty of color options for identifying different rods as well.  Note that this particular model in my opinion is a little too long for a 6' rod, but it nicely protects anything from 6-6 to 7-6+.  Beware, there is another brand on Amazon that did not accurately represent the size of the opening and would not fit over the larger bottom guides on several of my spinning rods.  This brand fits them perfectly.  5 stars all day."

Inside this little rigid, zippered case you\u2019ll find a thoughtfully produced pack of medical and emergency aids:<br /><br />Here\u2019s some of the things I found interesting about this kit:<br /><br />It contains some things you won\u2019t expect in a first aid kit; a shrill whistle, a mylar blanket, a working flash light (that works just out of the kit) and an interesting tool... that is a 'number of tools in one tool'; all of which are  non-medical, but things that can be very helpful in an emergency.<br /><br />Regarding the enigmatic \u2018number of tools in one\u2019 tool: On the web site they point out which part of the tool is which. In the actual kit, they just list the tools it\u2019s suppose to be, no indication which part of the tool, or cut out section of the metal piece, was which tool. We couldn\u2019t figure out which part of the tool was which. In an emergency, time is of the essence.<br /><br />It's important to know what\u2019s in your kit, what it's for, and how to use it.<br /><br />All the packets in the kit are clearly marked. That is very helpful. Pick up a packet and you know if it\u2019s a wound pad, sterile wipe, alcohol pad, sting relief pad, soap pad or eye pad. Our last kit didn\u2019t have everything labeled and when my leg was sliced open through the epidermis and fatty tissue, it was very frustrating. My partner couldn't see through the wrappers, nothing was labeled. Time was wasted.<br /><br />This kit also includes other medical aids besides band aids like  a sling, a cpr device, burn pads, ice pack, etc. All very helpful.<br /><br />I checked out the scissors. They work.<br /><br />Here\u2019s the thing...<br /><br />In an emergency you don\u2019t have time to shuffle through a bunch of stuff. The Kit needs an inventory list in sight. So, in a glance, you know what you have to work with. This one doesn\u2019t have one. Our last one had a booklet with no mention of anything having to do with cuts.<br /><br />In my estimation, very emergency kit needs butterfly bandages. If you\u2019re sliced open like I was, you need something to actually close the wound. The closest this comes to a butterfly bandage is knuckle bandages. Just a bandage that goes over knuckles.<br /><br />In my opinion, every emergency kit needs antibacterial ointment. This kit has soap wipes, alcohol wipes and lots of sting relief pads but no antibacterial ointment. Perhaps less sting relief and some antibacterial ointment would be good.<br /><br />Overall, it\u2019s a good little kit if you understand that they\u2019re trying to cover many bases. And you may need to evaluate for yourself what you think is necessary and useful."

So I watched countless YouTube videos on portable pool tables and was thinking that I would have to settle for a 6ftr but knew in my heart that I wouldn't be happy with that in the long run. So then i came across a video of a guy who had had a 7 ftr for 30 days before he game his review and after that, I was for sure going with a 7' with blue felt.<br />So I waited for the Prime Day sale, but the only 7' on sale was the black felt one, but the price was too good to pass up. At that time, they were selling for 549 but on Prime day I spent 315 including shipping and room placement. Unbelievable blessing.<br />This table is solid, easy to setup but it still takes 2 people, and lots of fun. At first it plays really slow but it gets better the more you play and brush it. Let's be clear,  it will never be as good as a slate table but its better than just ok. I love it, and the black felt color looks really good in my gray painted basement.  Several of my grandchildren came over to play this weekend and now they are begging my son for one.<br />All I can say is, get one and if you have the room for a 7' instead of a 6, then get it.
