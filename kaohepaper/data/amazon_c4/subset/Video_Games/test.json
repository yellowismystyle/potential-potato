        "query": "I'm in need of a keyboard that is a huge improvement over the typical cheap ones. I want something that is mechanical and better than the membrane keyboards. I've heard a lot about mechanical keyboards and their benefits, so I want to give them a try. I need a keyboard that not only feels and sounds good, but also improves my typing speed and response time. The sound and feel should make typing more enjoyable. Additionally, I want a keyboard that is hot swappable, but I understand that it can only be swapped with compatible optical switches. Optical switches are newer and have their own advantages, such as being faster and more durable. However, I know that the variety of optical switches is not as wide as standard mechanical switches. Nevertheless, I'm open to trying them out. Price-wise, I'm willing to spend close to what I would on a membrane keyboard, as long as I get more customization options and the ability to swap out switches and keycaps. Overall, I'm really excited about finding a keyboard that enhances my typing experience.",

        "ori_review": "Huge improvement over your typical cheap keyboards I've seen a lot of videos and read a lot of articles about mechanical keyboards and how much better they are than the typical membrane keyboard. I wasn't sure if I believed it, and even if I did, I thought that there was no way any of the cheap mechanical options would be any good at all. I was wrong. This keyboard is the absolute best keyboard I've ever used. It isn't just the feel and the sound either. This keyboard has actually improved my typing speed. The response and how quickly things happen is heads and shoulders above my old membrane board. The feel and sound just make everything more enjoyable IMO, so it's helped me want to do typing more often, which can be beneficial when I do get some of my income from doing a bit of freelance writing here and there (not that you can tell from my grammar in this review).<br /><br />Now, you do need to understand that while this is hot swappable, it is only hot swappable with other compatible optical switches. You can't just choose other mechanical switches and use them with this board. Optical switches are still mechanical, but they operate a bit differently and are not compatible with just standard mechanical switches. I knew this before I ordered it due to spending some time looking at a lot of reviews and information. There are benefits to optical though. They are faster, they last longer, they still have a similar, if not identical, feel to other mechanical switches. It's just that they are a newer option and therefore they do not have as many options out there, but at least they are made by at least one big name, Gateron, so it isn't as if they are some fringe technology that only some small company produces. You just won't find them in as many varieties as you can standard mechanical. At least not yet.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this keyboard and the price at the time was close to what I would have spent on a membrane keyboard anyway, just with more options at customization and the ability to swap out the switches, keycaps, and maybe do some modding (if you're brave enough...I'm not...yet) to really improve your experience. You can't do that with the standard $20 membrane board. I love it."

        "ori_review": "Good, quality headset. Kraken as a brand is known for making quality products that are functional, comfortable, and durable. The noise cancelling earpieces do a good job blocking out sound, and keeping your ears warm.<br /><br />The product comes as two separate parts: The audio controller (USB to 3.5) and the headset itself, which has a 3.5mm jack that plugs in at a 90 degree angle. I'll talk about the headset first.<br /><br />The headset uses quality fabric from top to bottom, a synthetic leather on top of the headband, with a more cushioned, lattice pattern fabric on bottom. The padding is very breathable and comfortable, so you don't need to worry about the headset slipping off when using them, barring the most excessive headbanging.<br /><br />The foam they use is a very soft, flexible kind of foam, so you don't need to worry about having the earpieces bite into any eyewear you are wearing. The extendable microphone has a soft arm, which means you can bend it to get the perfect angle for any face.<br /><br />Additionally, the audio quality is great for general use, meaning you'll get a good quality mic whether you're using it on console, PC or even mobile. When not in use, the microphone can be pushed back into the headset frame, making it very much out of your way when you're trying to enjoy some music.<br /><br />The headset has a barebones, inline volume dial and mute toggle. Both have held up after extensive (+1 year) usage in tandem with the audio controller. The wire used is a not very thick, but dense enough braid, so you won't have to worry about wire crimping or getting tangled in a travel bag or other container.<br /><br />Before we get started talking about the audio controller I'm going to be talking about the hardware, not the software currently, as while Razer is amazing a producing a great product, the software is notorious for several issues. The audio controller is a very small profile box at the end of a braided cable with a USB plugin. The box has buttons to raise and lower volume in general, a mute button that glows red when muted, and for the two audio channels the drivers for the device (without the software) create; game and chat.<br /><br />The two channels have two small actuators that return to a neutral position after adjusting volume for the respective channel. Finally, the audio controller has a button to enable THX spatial audio.<br /><br />The headset is 5.1 compatible for anyone wondering, and that should be good enough to satisfy most everyone.<br /><br />The major downsides are typically Razer's software. Most of my issues with razer have been drivers following a patch, typically requiring you to go into settings for all apps using audio settings, or have certain features not work for all setups.<br /><br />Frequently the default THX audio settings don't work, and audio doesn't separate into the two channels properly. All audio funnels into the chat channel for me personally, but there have been anecdotes of people having no issues getting it working.<br /><br />Overall, great hardware, just don't expect the full functionality the software claims. Treat it as a fancy UI and a way to keep your drivers updated, and you'll be happy."

Next issue is that the rgb backlighting on the rim is nearly impossible to change with the software, you have to do a dance to get the rim to change static color.

Plastic construction, manual online doesn't quite match the one in the box (which is correct), has bluetooth but you need to plug it in if you want the app to fiddle with RGB and whatnot, the usual sort of thing we see in sub-$100 hotswap switch keyboards in terms of frame, PCB, and features. I'm used to a TKL and 75% is taking some doing, if I'm honest. I'm just used to indexing the right edge of the key area to begin typing and I have a lot of nav cluster muscle memory. I am finally getting used to daily driving this board for serious typing work rather than using it long enough to determine that it's \"\"a good board, but…\"\" as I typically wind up doing. This is a good board, and…<br /><br />The included Akko shine-through white keycap set… First of all, it's a full set. It includes the 75% keycaps already installed on your keyboard, but there's a bag containing another the rest of the keys for a 104/105 style keyboard with a couple of alternate layouts. This suggests an attention to detail we'll come back to. If you've had an Akko keycap set before, you know what to expect for quality—absolutely a cut above the cheap caps you often see online. They're not going to win awards with the sorts of people who buy limited run group buy $350 custom keycap sets I suspect, but they're definitely good enough caps to keep if you replace them with a customized set.<br /><br />The stabilizers don't rattle, at all. And as advertised, there's foam inside to dampen any pinging sound that goes along with typing on other mechanical boards. And with the included switches, the only sound you're going to hear is the \"\"clack\"\" of the keys bottoming out if you bottom them out. (Faster typists generally don't unless they learned to type on something other than a computer keyboard.)<br /><br />I love these switches. I really love these switches. Most people get a set by Cherry or Kaihua (Kailh) or Gateron and call it a day. The rise of keyboards with hotswap sockets is resulting in more \"\"boutique\"\" keyswitches being made. Akko making these means they're maybe a little more likely to be available for purchase. That's a great thing, because these are some of the nicest feeling switches I've used right out of the package. I'm very happy with them—enough so that this Akko keyboard became my daily driver until I get a set of these for my more expensive, heavy aluminum framed keyboard.<br /><br />I've seen some really cheap keyboards in the sub-$50 range (as of Summer 2022) and called them good starter mechanical keyboards. Their switches were not awesome, but they're swappable and the keycaps were all right even if they weren't going to last long. Anything else you could upgrade or improve yourself you found yourself wanting foam noise dampening, higher quality stabilizers, better keycaps, and better quality switches, I figured. I'm no longer recommending that when for the added cost of any one of those upgrades you can have all of them in this keyboard. And you still have room for experimentation if you want it—you just no longer need it to get a decent level of performance.<br /><br />Bluetooth and the software weren't tested extensively. They worked, but I don't need to use them.\""

It pairs quickly like the OEM controllers, yet won't wake the switch from sleep like the OEM one will.  The cost is much cheaper, yet the feel of it in your hand seem very similar, though slightly lighter weight.  We have not had it long enough to judge durability or battery, but there is no reason not to think it won't hold up to equal use.  Our favorite switch game is Tetris Attack (Puzzle League), which relies heavily on the D-pad.  The Joy-Con controllers actually work best in our opinion since that consists of separate buttons, but this controller is a close second.  The switches on the D-pad have a bit more resistance, and so your thumb pressure has be slightly heavier.<br /><br />The vibration was a bit to strong at first, but we found setting it to the lower setting made it closer to OEM.<br /> That is done using the turbo button and moving up and down with the analog stick.  For the cost we found this to be a great controller and highly recommend it."

Immediately, I found that I was hearing sounds that I hadn't heard before!<br /><br />As the character walked around, I heard the jangling sounds of the equipment he had at his belt, I heard the companion character talking behind me and as I turned, her voice moved around my head.  I was super impressed!<br /><br />I then disconnected the dongle and tried the headset in bluetooth mode.  The sound was a little muffled and there was almost no surround effect, even though the game still said that it was doing virtual surround.<br /><br />So I'm definitely using the dongle for all my gaming.  I love this thing!\""

I’ve been, individually, looking for a case, and a screen protector, and some thumb grips for my switch lite, but whenever the total would get calculated, it costed a lot more money compared to this item(s).<br /><br />The thumb grips were easy to put on, and so was the case. The case fit perfectly and it’s not a hassle to take off again. I put on the screen protector with no troubles too. Of course be careful putting it on, you have to eye it, and if u mess it up the alignment, then i’d hate to be u. One thing buyer should be aware of though is that there may be a chance that the wipes that come with the screen protector may both be dry (you get a wet wipe and then a dry wipe to clean your screen but they both arrived dry for me but i found another way around that so it was no biggy for me).<br /><br />Nonetheless, I recommend, especially, if ur not trying to spend a ridiculous amount."

My daughter and I spent a while punching out and putting together all the follies before we read the instructions, only to find out you don’t even need them for the basic game. Lol. You can get started with just the cards and walls set up. It’s all beautifully produced and a pleasure to look at while playing. It can be played competitively or cooperatively, and you’re supposed to decide which before you start. It’s a challenge to play it cooperatively without talking about cards in your hand, and it was surprisingly difficult at first to even score a medal together. Now that we’ve played it both ways, I inevitably look to see what medal we earned together even if we’ve played competitively.<br /><br />This is a fun game for our family that likes flowers and gardens, but it’s not high drama. We don’t pull it out when the boy cousins come over. It’s not always the first choice when we decide to play, but it’s a great addition to our large library of games. It’s low-key yet satisfying."

I did my research and ordered the Kiwi Design strap.  The Kiwi strap is super comfortable with great padding by the back of your head, but it was lacking a built in battery to keep your session going longer.  After further research I was able to zip tie a small power bank to the back of the strap, which was fine, but kind of an eye sore.  Now on to this current strap…. Super easy installation with just two clicks into the sides and loop the band on the top.  The back head area is a hard flexible plastic versus the Kiwi’s soft padding, but after putting it on, I really didn’t mind it but we will see how it feels after a couple of hours.  The battery pack is integrated nicely to the back and adds a nice counter balance while your moving around.  The adjustment knob works smooth and the USB-C cable is hidden which keeps it out of the way.  Really nice replacement and gives Kiwi Design a run for their money.

I loved the idea of the game being set in the future and going after Satan's children. However, as the game went on, I felt like I saw less of Dracula and more of Gabriel reemerging after years in darkness. I think the game was rushed in the middle, especially during the fight with Victor/Nergal. I would have liked more time with Victor and a stealth mission to confront Nergal in a weapons factory, rather than him easily defeating Victor. In the third game, I would have fought tooth and nail against him and his followers as he summoned Satan himself. I also would have changed the ending because Satan was a coward for hiding from Gabriel again.

I loved the game concept of being in the future and going after satans kids but as the game progressed i saw less of dracula and more of gabriel coming back to the surface after soo many years of being in darkness. I feel that this game was defintily rushed in the middle of the game like for example fighting victor/nergal, i would have loved to for victor to have lived longer and do a stealth session of going into a weapon factory to confront nergal instead of getting his butt zapped by him, as for the 3rd one i would have fought tooth and nail to fight him and his followers as he was summoning satan himself. I would have changed the ending up too cause satan was a coward for hiding from gabriel again and i loved playing the dlc part cause you could feel what gabriel was going through as he was transitioned from human to vampire(with now the forgotten ones power in him), you could hear his screams of anguish and see i assume it was his own blood he had written his wife's name all over the place near the end of the forbidden wing, but i loved playing as alicard and would have loved to have seen more of him fighting in the city, meeting up with his contacts(maintaining his charade as the assitant to zobek) and at least find out who the guy in the armor was before alucard killed him. But mostly i wanted to know what lay ahead for both of them at the end like deciding to put their differences aside and be father/son or leave the city and travel the world together or something like that.

I got away with using the flash drive to store the save files for some of the games, but some games for the Xbox are completely unplayable without the hard-drive.<br /><br />Flawless functions once I installed the drive into my xbox and never looked back. But now I'm here to leave this review.<br /><br />Excellent work on this quality product. 10/10"
