This might involve features like international shipping compatibility, universal sizing, etc.\n   - **Relevance:** We need to ensure that the products are relevant to the customer's needs, which might include features like durability, size compatibility, etc.\n\n3. **Query Structure:**\n   - We need to ensure that the query is structured logically, using AND and OR operators to ensure that all components are considered.\n\n4. **Query Components:**\n   - **Size Query:** We need to ensure that the size is exactly 900.\n   - **Global Query:** We need to ensure that the products are suitable for international use.\n   - **Relevance Query:** We need to ensure that the products are relevant to the customer's needs.\n\n5. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - **AND:** Ensures that all components must be true.\n   - **OR:** Ensures that at least one component must be true.\n\n6. **Query Construction:**\n   - The query should ensure that the size is exactly 900 AND the products are suitable for international use AND the products are relevant to the customer's needs.\n\n7. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should be structured as follows:\n     - Size: 900\n     - Global: suitable for international use\n     - Relevance: relevant to customer's needs\n\n8. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - The query should be structured as:\n     - (Size: 900 AND Global: suitable for international use AND Relevance: relevant to customer's needs)\n\n9. **JSON Format:**\n   - The query should be structured in JSON format, ensuring that all components are logically connected.\n\nLet's construct the query in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(Size: 900 AND Global: suitable for international use AND Relevance: relevant to customer's needs)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that all components must be true for the query to be considered relevant. The query ensures that the products are of the exact size, suitable for international use, and relevant to the customer's needs.\n\nFinal JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(Size: 900 AND Global: suitable for international use AND Relevance: relevant to customer's needs)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the query is logically structured and ensures that all components are considered. The final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(Size: 900 AND Global: suitable for international use AND Relevance: relevant to customer's needs)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the query is logically structured and ensures that all components are considered.

It is a catch-all term that can encompass a wide range of products, from consumer electronics to beauty products, and even some niche items. The goal is to ensure that the query retrieves products that are relevant to the customer, which means we need to consider multiple aspects of the query.\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Query:**\n   - **TV Advertising:** The first aspect is the TV advertising itself. We need to ensure that the products are advertised on TV, which is a critical factor for relevance.\n   - **Relevance to the Customer:** The second aspect is ensuring that the products are relevant to the customer.
