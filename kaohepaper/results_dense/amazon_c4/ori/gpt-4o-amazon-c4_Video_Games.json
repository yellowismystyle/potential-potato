They have also mentioned specific elements they liked and disliked, such as the game's pacing and certain battles. \n\nTo generate a more effective query for dense retrieval, I need to identify the key interests and expand on them using relevant terms and concepts that are associated with the game series.

I was really drawn to the game because I wanted to see what Gabriel, now a demigod with new abilities and also a powerful vampire lord, would do. I expected him to continue fighting the brotherhood until they were all defeated, living in his castle indefinitely since he can't be killed. I loved the idea of the game being set in the future and going after Satan's children. However, as the game went on, I felt like I saw less of Dracula and more of Gabriel reemerging after years in darkness. I think the game was rushed in the middle, especially during the fight with Victor/Nergal. I would have liked more time with Victor and a stealth mission to confront Nergal in a weapons factory, rather than him easily defeating Victor. In the third game, I would have fought tooth and nail against him and his followers as he summoned Satan himself. I also would have changed the ending because Satan was a coward for hiding from Gabriel again. I really enjoyed the DLC part where I could feel Gabriel's anguish as he transformed from human to vampire with the Forgotten Ones' power. I could hear his screams and see the writings of his wife's story.
