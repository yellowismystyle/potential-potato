Comfort-wise, the headband is not as plush as the Arctis 7, but with a bit of adjustment, it fits snugly without causing any discomfort during long hours. I also appreciate that it blocks out a good amount of external noise, which helps me stay focused. However, if you're looking to game with these, adjusting chat volume on the fly might be a bit of a hassle due to the limited controls.
