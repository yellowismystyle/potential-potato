        "generated_text": "<think>To generate the most effective query terms for retrieving relevant products related to \"18 inch batman,\" we need to consider the following elements:\n\n1. The primary focus is on \"Batman,\" which is likely a character or theme. Products associated with Batman can be toys, collectibles, apparel, etc.\n2. The specific detail \"18 inch\" suggests a size constraint. This might pertain to figures, plush toys, or other items that have a size specification.\n3. We want to ensure the search captures products that are both related to Batman and match the size requirement.\n\nThus, the query should ensure that products meet both the thematic (Batman) and size (18 inch) criteria. Using Boolean operators, we should structure the query such that it narrows down the search to items that are explicitly related to Batman and are 18 inches.\n\nThe query can be structured as:\n- Include \"Batman\" as a must-have term.\n- Include \"18 inch\" as a must-have term.\n- Optionally consider synonyms or related terms like \"figure,\" \"toy,\" or \"collectible\" to broaden the search in a relevant manner.\n\nOur logical query would look like: (\"Batman\" AND \"18 inch\") AND (\"figure\" OR \"toy\" OR \"collectible\"). This ensures that we are targeting products that are both Batman-related and 18 inches in size, while also considering the type of product that a customer might be searching for.\n\nNow, let's construct the JSON format using this logic.</think>\n\n<answer>\n{\n    \"query\": \"(Batman AND 18 inch) AND (figure OR toy OR collectible)\"\n}\n</answer>",

Ensure it's specifically for a bottle: (\"bottle\" OR \"container\")\n\nNow, combine these with AND operators to ensure all criteria are met in the search results. This will create a comprehensive search query.\n\nThe final query will be structured as:\n(\"insulated\" OR \"thermal\" OR \"temperature-controlled\") AND (\"holder\" OR \"carrier\" OR \"sleeve\") AND (\"20 oz\" OR \"20 ounce\" OR \"twenty oz\") AND (\"bottle\" OR \"container\")</think>\n\n<answer>\n{\n    \"query\": \"(\\\"insulated\\\" OR \\\"thermal\\\" OR \\\"temperature-controlled\\\") AND (\\\"holder\\\" OR \\\"carrier\\\" OR \\\"sleeve\\\") AND (\\\"20 oz\\\" OR \\\"20 ounce\\\" OR \\\"twenty oz\\\") AND (\\\"bottle\\\" OR \\\"container\\\")\"\n}\n</answer>",

        "generated_text": "<think>To generate query terms for the given search, we need to identify the key components of the query and structure them logically using Boolean operators.\n\n1. Identify key terms:\n   - \"Zodiac C6\": This seems to be a product model or brand specification.\n   - \"large wheel\": Describes the size/type of the wheel needed.\n   - \"without bearing\": Specifies a feature or exclusion criterion.\n   - \"replacement\": Indicates the need for a replacement part.\n\n2. Structure the query:\n   - We want to ensure that products related to \"Zodiac C6\" are prioritized, so this should be a mandatory term.\n   - The \"large wheel\" is another essential feature, and it should also be included as a mandatory term.\n   - \"without bearing\" is a specific exclusion, so we need to ensure that products do not include bearings.\n   - \"replacement\" is a key term indicating the purpose of the product.\n\n3. Formulate the query:\n   - We use AND to ensure all these criteria are met.\n   - We can consider \"without bearing\" as a NOT condition to exclude any products that include bearings.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the structured Boolean query should include all necessary terms and exclusion criteria.</think>\n\n<answer>\n{\n    \"query\": \"(\\\"Zodiac C6\\\" AND \\\"large wheel\\\" AND \\\"replacement\\\" AND NOT \\\"bearing\\\")\"\n}\n</answer>",
