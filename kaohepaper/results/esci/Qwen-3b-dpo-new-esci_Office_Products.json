However, for the sake of this exercise, we'll assume it's \"0zo not bit\" (with a space for clarity).\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Query:**\n   - The query \"0zo not bit\" can be broken down into two parts: \"0zo\" and \"not bit\".\n   - \"0zo\" likely refers to a specific code or identifier, and \"not bit\" likely refers to a specific bit or a bit that is not included.\n\n3. **Query Terms:**\n   - **Part 1: \"0zo\"**\n     - We need to ensure that products related to \"0zo\" are included.\n     - We also need to ensure that products related to \"0zo\" are not related to \"not bit\".\n   - **Part 2: \"not bit\"**\n     - We need to ensure that products related to \"not bit\" are included.\n     - We also need to ensure that products related to \"not bit\" are not related to \"0zo\".\n\n4. **Boolean Operators:**\n   - We need to use AND to ensure that both parts are included.\n   - We need to use OR to ensure that products related to either \"0zo\" or \"not bit\" are included.\n\n5. **Query Structure:**\n   - The query should be structured as follows:\n     - (0zo AND not bit) OR (not bit AND 0zo)\n     - (0zo AND not bit) AND (not bit AND 0zo)\n     - (0zo AND not bit) OR (not bit AND 0zo) AND (0zo AND not bit)\n\n6. **Final Query:**\n   - The query should ensure that products related to \"0zo\" and \"not bit\" are included, and that products related to either \"0zo\" or \"not bit\" are included, but not both at the same time.\n\nLet's construct the query:\n\n- **Query 1:**\n  - (0zo AND not bit) OR (not bit AND 0zo)\n  - This ensures that products related to \"0zo\" and \"not bit\" are included, but not both at the same time.\n\n- **Query 2:**\n  - (0zo AND not bit) AND (not bit AND 0zo)\n  - This ensures that products related to \"0zo\" and \"not bit\" are included, but not both at the same time.\n\n- **Query 3:**\n  - (0zo AND not bit) OR (not bit AND 0zo) AND (0zo AND not bit)\n  - This ensures that products related to \"0zo\" and \"not bit\" are included, and that products related to either \"0zo\" or \"not bit\" are included, but not both at the same time.\n\nThe final query should be structured as follows:\n\n- **Query 1:**\n  - (0zo AND not bit) OR (not bit AND 0zo)\n  - (0zo AND not bit) AND (not bit AND 0zo)\n  - (0zo AND not bit) OR (not bit AND 0zo) AND (0zo AND not bit)\n\n- **Query 2:**\n  - (0zo AND not bit) AND (not bit AND 0zo)\n\n- **Query 3:**\n  - (0zo AND not bit) OR (not bit AND 0zo) AND (0zo AND not bit)\n\nLet's construct the JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"(0zo AND not bit) OR (not bit AND 0zo) AND (0zo AND not bit) OR (not bit AND 0zo) AND (0zo AND not bit) AND (0zo AND not bit) AND (not bit AND 0zo) AND (0zo AND not bit) AND (not bit AND 0zo) AND (0zo AND not bit) AND (not bit AND 0zo) AND (0zo AND not bit) AND (not bit AND 0zo) AND (0zo AND not bit) AND (not bit AND 0zo) AND (0zo AND not bit) AND (not bit AND 0zo) AND (0zo AND not bit) AND (not bit AND 0zo) AND (0zo AND not bit) AND (not bit AND 0zo) AND (0zo AND not bit) AND (not bit AND 0zo) AND (0zo AND not bit) AND (not bit AND 0zo) AND (0zo AND not bit) AND (not bit AND 0zo) AND (0zo AND not bit) AND (not bit",
